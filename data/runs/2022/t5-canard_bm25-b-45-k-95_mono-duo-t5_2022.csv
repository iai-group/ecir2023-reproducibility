Credit: Left - Mellimage/Shutterstock.com, center - Montree Hanlue/Shutterstock.com.  › en español Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment.  Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner.  Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves.  Taken as a whole, the range of published evidence indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time.  Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.	306.6028297686962

On 28 May 2020, the COP Bureau decided that it would take place from 1-12 November 2021, in Glasgow, UK.  The change in dates had been anticipated following a decision, on 1 April 2020, to postpone the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  At that time, the COP Bureau announced that: “In light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible.  Rescheduling will ensure all parties can focus on the issues to be discussed at this vital conference and allow more time for the necessary preparations to take place.  We will continue to work with all involved to increase climate ambition, build resilience and lower emissions.”  The Italy-hosted Pre-COP and 'Youth for the Climate' event are also postponed.

9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that. Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage.  And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor.  Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality.  For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires.  Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .”  Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death.  Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks.  As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	237.00241093104705
10	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_11_94725514-2	Climate change can affect human health in two main ways: first, by changing the severity or frequency of health problems that are already affected by climate or weather factors; and second, by creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems or health threats in places or times of the year where they have not previously occurred. Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, but some populations will be especially affected.  These groups include the poor, some communities of color, limited English-proficiency and immigrant groups, indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, people with disabilities, and people with medical conditions.  Overview The impacts of climate change include warming temperatures, changes in precipitation, increases in the frequency or intensity of some extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.  These impacts threaten our health by affecting the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the weather we experience.  The severity of these health risks will depend on the ability of public health and safety systems to address or prepare for these changing threats, as well as factors such as an individual's behavior, age, gender, and economic status.	117.50509052723646
11	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts. Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem.  The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health.  Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	115.60965150222182

16	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_18_3480200950-24	The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history.  Currently climate change is affecting the global community in each country of the world.  Its impact affects not only national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions.  By 2018, climate change continued exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods, affecting more than 39 million of people.  Over the period 2000–2018, green house emissions of developed countries and economies in transitions have declined by 6.5%.  The emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013.  In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.  Plastic polymers are derived from fossil fuels and plastics account for 6% of global oil consumption.  Therefore, plastics and GHG emissions are intricately connected with every step of the plastic life cycle, from production to transportation to waste disposal, contributing to climate change.	306.3017405417432
17	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	WAPO_9f85adbcb1416059e2ade966dd9155db-1	It’s well known that climate change will probably affect some places more severely than others.  In general, scientists think developing nations will be hit hardest by such effects as an increase in severe weather events, drought and famine, and a boost in the spread of infectious diseases.  But a new study reminds us that the effect of climate change in one place is capable of radiating throughout the rest of the world.  The research, which was published Friday in the journal Science Advances, suggests that globalization — and the increasing connectedness among countries — can cause climate-related problems in one place to reverberate all over the globe.  “There’s still the open question of will we feel anything of climate change, anything significant, in the industrialized world,” said lead author Anders Levermann, a professor of climate systems dynamics at Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.  “What we find is that we are living in a globalized world, and that production failure in poor countries can affect richer countries — and that is relevant information that needs to be investigated much more.”  The study focuses on the global supply chain network, which includes all the trade links between countries around the world.	294.8054667196284
18	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).  These investments can help spur an even larger clean energy economy around the world, unleash additional emission reduction efforts, and help countries address the devastating impacts of climate change that will set back the well-being of their citizens.	139.51750080636702
19	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250272123-2	To provide predictability on climate finance, developed countries will communicate every two years on projected levels of public climate finance to be provided to developing countries. Developing countries will report on climate finance they will provide on a voluntary basis.  Regular updates send a signal for where low-carbon investments can be made, and the resources available to help the most vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Broadening the donor base The broadening of the donor pool is important, because it recognizes the fact that many developing countries are already contributing climate finance.  Countries that were considered low-income developing countries several decades ago are now in a position which allows them to contribute climate finance for less developed countries.  Countries including Vietnam and Chile have already pledged funds to the Green Climate Fund, and China has pledged $3.1 billion for South-South cooperation between developing countries.  The new Agreement makes clear that developed countries are not shirking their responsibilities for climate finance --- which is a responsibility already recognized as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Developing countries are not obligated to provide climate finance, but they are welcomed to contribute financing for climate activities without diluting the responsibilities of developed nations to provide climate finance.	137.6517918817699
20	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_15_1888001823-3	Adaptation Governments agreed to strengthen societies' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change; provide continued and enhanced international support for adaptation to developing countries. Loss and damage The agreement also recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; acknowledges the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.  Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.  A new and higher goal will be set for after this period.	133.45515399356373
21	132_2-7	Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?	MARCO_48_1251187189-9	Countries are also expected to revisit their pledges and put forward progressively stronger targets every five years, with the goal of further driving down emissions. Nations must participate in a “ global stocktake ” to measure collective efforts toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals as well.  Meanwhile, developed countries also have to estimate how much financial assistance they’ll allocate to developing nations to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in the frameworks of other international agreements.  While the system doesn’t include financial penalties, the requirements are aimed at making the progress of individual nations easy to track and fostering a sense of global peer pressure, discouraging any dragging of feet among countries that may consider doing so.  Mobilize support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing nations.  Recognizing that many developing countries and small island nations that have contributed the least to climate change could suffer the most from its consequences, the Paris Agreement includes a plan for developed countries—and others “in a position to do so”—to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries mitigate and increase resilience to climate change.	185.01116373820696
22	132_2-7	Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?	MARCO_25_570836921-8	This will make it far easier to draw in the largest pools of capital that need long-term certainty in order to invest in clean technologies. Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	155.1902158894227
23	132_2-7	Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?	MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).

WAPO_5QBM6RQTVMI6VHGXUG7MXSBPLY-1	MADRID — Mass protests, a last-minute venue change and talk of climate tipping points are adding some unplanned drama to this year’s international conference on tackling global warming.  Delegates from almost 200 countries had hoped to put the finishing touches on the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord, ironing out a few wrinkles left over from last year’s conference in Katowice, Poland, and setting the scene for a major review of their efforts in 2020.  But a year ago, Brazil pulled its offer to host the talks, and last month, stand-in Chile, rattled by anti-government protests, canceled five weeks before the meeting.  Next, President Trump served formal notice that the United States was quitting the Paris accord, delivering a symbolic blow to one of his predecessor’s signature achievements.  And scientists?  Well, they didn’t have any good news, either.  Study after study published in recent months has underscored the rapid pace of global warming and the need to urgently cut emissions of greenhouse gases.  Against that backdrop, the Dec. 2-13 meeting in Madrid has gained fresh impetus.  “We have to do more in less time,” said Spain’s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, whose country stepped in to host the talks.	207.09412963343493

WAPO_7X7AWMCHIQI6VENLZZBZVJOHYE-1	"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson began a ""year of climate action"" on Tuesday, hours after the former president of the U.N. climate conference said the British leader doesn't ""get"" climate change.  The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit.  Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday.  Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.”  Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  He also announced that Britain will ban new gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035, cutting the current target of 2040 by five years.  Other countries, such as Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, are banning fossil fuel vehicles by 2030.  Britain’s car industry questioned whether the goal is achievable."	306.0411309736943

KILT_54199706-2	While celebrated by some members of the Republican Party, international reactions to the withdrawal were overwhelmingly negative from across the political spectrum, and the decision received substantial criticism from religious organizations, businesses, political leaders of all parties, environmentalists, and scientists and citizens from the United States and internationally.  Following Trump's announcement, the governors of several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to continue to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal.  As of April 29, 2019, 23 states and Puerto Rico have joined the alliance, and similar commitments have also been expressed by other state governors, mayors, and businesses.   Section::::Background.   The Paris Agreement was an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year, including the United States then under the presidency of Barack Obama.  Due to the status of the United States and China as the greatest emitters of carbon dioxide, Obama's support and his cooperation with China were seen as major factors leading to the convention's early success.	107.531833473593

As uncertainty loomed Wednesday about the future of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, the rest of the world was left to react to the country’s official departure from the Paris accord — a move that Trump had been promising since he took office, saying he considered it an unfair deal for the country.  A joint statement from the leaders of Chile, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United Nations expressed “regret” at the U.S. withdrawal.  But they insisted that the world would carry on regardless.  “We remain committed to working with all U.S. stakeholders and partners around the world to accelerate climate action, and with all signatories to ensure the full implementation of the Paris agreement,” the group wrote, adding, “There is no greater responsibility than protecting our planet and people from the threat of climate change.  The science is clear that we must urgently scale up action and work together to reduce the impacts of global warming and to ensure a greener, more resilient future for us all.”  The U.S. decision to withdraw, while long expected, also encountered stiff criticism at home.	96.58689125999808

He was a critical voice in crafting strategy in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in encouraging Obama to send Navy SEALs on a mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden in 2011.  Biden also helped oversee the president’s first-term economic stimulus package and pressed unsuccessfully for gun-control legislation after the killing of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.

Before becoming the Vice President, he had represented Delaware as a United States Senator from 1973 to 2009.  Born in a middle-class family in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden learned the value of hard word, determination and perseverance from his parents who always encouraged him to stand up for himself and bounce back after failures.  As a child he used to stammer but he overcame this problem by memorizing and reciting long passages in front of the mirror.  He went on to study law and also developed interest in politics.  He joined the Democratic Party and became active in politics alongside managing his legal career.  He won the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware when he was just 29 and assumed office the next year.  A devastating family tragedy threatened to end his career, but he persevered on bravely.  He proved to be a popular senator and set his ambitions higher.

This has not been the case across the entire current administration, Biden explained, but in a number of areas, “the professionals are at a loss” to explain where things stand.  Chaos and lack of clarity are hobbling the current administration and are making the transition particularly difficult.  “I can’t tell if I have a clear view of where the landmines are,” Biden confessed.  In a noteworthy revelation, the president-elect said he has consulted Republican appointees who are no longer in office to try to get a handle on what is going on.  (He also confirmed his team has not received a Defense Department briefing since Dec. 17 or Dec. 18.)  This fog in the transition process partly explains his Cabinet picks so far: “You need old hands to know where the old bodies are buried,” he joked.

Through these investments the United States continues to lead the world in our investments in global health to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic and contribute to an AIDS free generation, fight malaria and TB, reduce maternal and child deaths, and strengthen health systems.  Today, the President announced ambitious new targets for PEPFAR, including a U.S. goal to reach a total of 11.4 million people with HIV/AIDS treatment by the end of 2016, and 12.9 million people by the end of 2017; achieve a 25% decrease in HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24) within the highest burden geographic areas of 10 sub-Saharan African countries jointly with partners by the end of 2016; and achieve a 40% decrease in HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women (aged 15-24) within these areas by the end of 2017.	257.61092579492833

The United States, in this scenario, would have to go from lowering its emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 (its current goal), to cutting them by 45 percent by 2030.  Other nations would have to make similarly large improvements on what they are currently promising to do.  And even then, due to scientific uncertainty, the planet could still conceivably overshoot 2 degrees, and there is only a 66 percent or greater chance of getting there.  Of course, the actual embraced goal of the world is to stay “well below” 2 degrees, a target that suggests prudent avoidance, not walking right up to it and potentially going over.  Accordingly, the study also examined what it would take to suppress emissions fast enough to hit 1.5 degrees C. Here we’d have to have global emissions peak in 2020 and then decline by 5.9 percent annually thereafter.  The United States, here, would have to get its emissions 60 percent below their 2005 levels by 2030.  This is extreme, but then, that’s what it would take.  If we want to buy time, we have to save forests.   There’s some good news here.	138.56756306509487

Will Paris solve the problem of climate change?  There are no magical or instant solutions to climate change.  The climate challenge is one of the most complex the world has ever faced.  But climate change has now risen to the top of the global agenda and countries, cities, the private sector, civil society, faith leaders and individual citizens are taking action.  In preparing for Paris, more than 150 countries have submitted national climate targets covering nearly 90 per cent of global emissions.  An agreement in Paris will not be the end point, but it can be a decisive turning point in how all countries, acting together under an agreed, transparent legal framework, will set out a pathway to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius – the internationally agreed goal.	261.1377541984107
42	132_2-13	How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?	WAPO_MFJTN65BNZCQTCCG5CUTO6SJOM-1	The latest round of global climate negotiations just concluded in the coal city of Katowice, Poland.  This was the 24th meeting of the “conference of the parties” (COP) to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change — and the most important meeting since COP 21, the 2015 Paris agreement.    What was at stake?  This year’s negotiations were about finalizing the “Paris rule book” — and they somewhat miraculously did, with an accord on the rules finally reached Saturday.  The Paris agreement ushered in a different approach to reducing greenhouse gases, after previous false starts.  Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve.  Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.  In Katowice, negotiators sought to finalize the rules governing those requirements.  The theory was that the international system has weak compliance mechanisms — so the best hope is for countries to figure out what they can do, get started and raise their ambition over time.	416.671602705685

The United States preferred for China and India—two wealthy, powerful nations that also contain hundreds of millions of people still in poverty—to pitch into that $100 billion target.  Yet even as those two Asian nations talked up their own investment in climate-vulnerable nations, they blanched at being compelled to join the rich world’s pledge.  The solution: So here’s something counter-intuitive.  The text commonly called the “Paris Agreement” is actually two different documents: the agreement itself, which is legally binding, and the Paris decision, which passes the agreement and sets out a number of less legally binding ways to approach and observe it.  The Paris agreement includes no new specific commitments to finance.  But item 115 of the Paris decision says that more than that $100 billion will be needed:  *  *  * How often should nations check and reassess their emission reductions?  The problem: Two different mechanisms apply here.  The first is stock-taking, when countries will announce how they’ve reduced carbon emissions.  The draft Paris agreement now says global stock-takes will take place every five years.	352.2558159386158

Include clippers, files, pumice stones, scrubs, creams, soaking agents, and of course a new pot of nail polish.  Place it all inside a cosmetic tote so it stays together, making it easy to grab when mom has 15 minutes to herself.  17.  A Game And A Promise Got a mom who loves an evening spent playing cards or board games?  Grab her a new game and promise to come over one night and play a few rounds with her.  I am a mom who loves this and I have Bananagrams on my Christmas list this year.  18.  New Winter Accessory Items If your mom is absent-minded like me, she probably loses at least one winter weather accessory a year whether it be a hat, gloves or a scarf.  If not, sometimes it is just nice to update these items to the latest styles such as a blanket scarf.  19.	130.28947094481555

Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients.

To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well.  Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture.  Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover.  The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	241.25695757300127

54	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor. It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks.  STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48.  Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7.  Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10.  Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22.  Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes.  These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48.  Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection.  Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	333.29540896509843
55	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1385660336-6	Moisturizing Gentle on sensitive skin Applied with fingers Can feel sticky at first Natural Natural deodorants use baking soda, salt crystals, or essential oils to combat sweat and odor. All-natural products No aluminum salts, parabens, or other chemicals Come in stick, spray, cream, and solid “crystal” forms Scented or unscented Not necessarily hypoallergenic (Essential oils can cause itching, irritation, or skin rashes.)  Did you know?  Most deodorants have fragrance, so choose one that complements your perfume or just smells nice.  Also check any reactions to your skin before you buy one.  STAFF BestReviews Women’s deodorant prices There are deodorants for women that cost from $5 to $20 and more, but there’s no reason to spend more than a few dollars.  While you can certainly spend more – there are designer, specialty, and natural products that cost more than $20 – most women can find an effective deodorant at the drugstore that costs about $5.  Tips Cover your entire underarm area.  Many women just swipe the deodorant up and down a couple of times without coming in contact all of the skin in their armpits.  Apply deodorant at bedtime.	250.91650258923252

59	133_2-1	Can you tell me how to make a body scrub at home?	MARCO_34_552141024-6	Step 1: Prep Fabric To make the DIY makeup remover pads, you'll need half a yard each of double gauze fabric and an organic bamboo terry fabric. Prewash and dry both fabrics, then lay the fabrics down with right sides together.  Cut the fabric into 4-inch squares.  You'll need one square of each fabric for each makeup remover pad you want to make: We suggest making one for each day of the week, so you only have to wash them once a week.  Step 2: Sew Fabric Squares Once you've cut the fabric squares, place one gauze square on top of a terry square with right sides together and clip or pin the fabric in place.  Use a ¼-inch seam allowance to sew around all four edges, leaving a one-inch opening on one side.  Clip the corners and turn the pad right side out.  Repeat this step for each pad you want to make.  Step 3: Finish Sewing Pads Once you've sewn and turned each pad right side out, fold in the edges of the one-inch opening and iron to flatten the seams.  Then topstitch with a 1/8-inch seam allowance around all four edges of the pad, which will close the gap you left earlier.	156.9819049577345

Once you’ve grabbed your wipe, immediately replace the lid of your jar (or zip up your bag).  Unfold your wipe.  Gently glide it over your skin, taking care not to tug around the delicate eye area.  Once you’re finished removing your makeup, you can rinse your face with water to remove any residue, if desired.  But a second cleanser is not necessary, as these wipes cleanse while they remove makeup.  Proceed with the rest of your skincare routine as usual.  Remember that these wipes aren’t just for makeup.

Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.  Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container.  Enjoy your new scented body lotion.  Warnings Choose a good quality lotion to avoid problems with separation and spoilage.	182.3644177862443
69	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_58_105794544-8	You can use a single essential oil or a combination of several—it's completely customizable. If you aren’t sure what scents you like, you might try: Lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent Rose oil for a classic floral fragrance Citrus oils like sweet orange and grapefruit for a bright, energetic scent Patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent Myrrh, frankincense, or benzoin for a dramatic, resinous scent Tip: Always use high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oil for your lotion.  Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin.  2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil.  At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance.  If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again.  However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil.  Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted.  3 Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color.

MARCO_15_1872813287-3	So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils. Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin.  So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion.  But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion.  Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils.  Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well.  So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc.  Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.	126.65915910209424
71	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_24_1169299216-5	The type of essential oils you use will depend on the purpose of the lotion: Peppermint and ginger for cooling massage lotions after exercise. Calendula and chamomile for sensitive skin.  Argan oil and patchouli for anti-aging face creams.  Aqueous vs. Oil Lotions The main difference between a lotion and body butter is how much water is in it.  With most creams, more than half of the tub is water.  When you’re making home-made lotions, the problem with water is that it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold.  This means that to keep the lotion fresh, you need to add some sort of preservative.  Some essential oils, such as tea tree, make good preservatives, so if you are planning on adding those to your blend, then that may be enough to preserve a small tub of lotion.  If you don’t want to add preservatives, though, you’re going to struggle.  Body butter is less likely to go rancid quickly, but a lot of people don’t like them because of the texture.  Water-based oils are a good choice for those people, and there are some active ingredients such as rose water, aloe juice, and witch hazel that are water soluble and work well in water-based lotions.	120.9115220669537
72	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_23_881727735-2	Formulation: 90% Cyclomethicone 5% Artisan’s Perfume Base 5% fragrance oil Step 1 Using the Funnel Pitcher and scale, weigh out 8 ounces of Cyclomethicone. Step 2 Measure by weight .40 ounce of body safe Fragrance Oil and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  We used Light Blue type fragrance oil in this recipe.  Usage is 5% of fragrance oil to the Cyclomethicone.  In this tutorial, 5% of 8 ounces is .40 ounces.  Step 3 Add 5% of the Artisan’s Perfume Base.  Weigh out .40 ounce of the Artisan’s Perfume Base and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  The Artisan’s Perfume Base will add a cooling effect to the spray.  Step 4 Stir slowly until fully incorporated.  Cyclomethicone stays completely blended and crystal clear without the need for shaking.  Step 5 Slowly pour the product into 2-ounce Tapered PET Spray bottles.  This tutorial will make four 2-ounce bottles of Dry Oil Spray.  Step 6 Mix and match fragrance oils to come up with a unique scent.  Enjoy!  DIY Crafting Tutorials - spread the love!

The Spruce / David Fisher Add Fragrance or Essential Oils After the soap mixture is completely blended, but before it gets too thick, slowly add any fragrance or essential oils from your recipe to the mixture.  Stop stick blending the mixture and just use the end of the stick blender like a spoon.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Additives or Extras If your recipe calls for additives such as spices, natural exfoliants, flower petals, herbs, or special moisturizing oils, now is the time to add them.  As you did with the fragrance, gently stir them into the pot using the stick blender as a spoon.  Before you move on to adding the colorant, give the mixture a brief blend with the stick blender to make sure that the fragrance oil and additives are well mixed.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Color to the Soap Next, add color to the soap.  If you want the soap to be one single color, add the colorant to the pot and stir.  If you want to achieve a swirl effect, do the following: Ladle about 1/2 to 1 cup of the soap mixture into a measuring cup.  Add the colorant to that bit of soap.	165.54617630172652
75	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone. Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing?  Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs?  Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer.  Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device?  If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone.  Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out.  This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying.  Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance.  What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs?  It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting.  Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	191.85675089081636

Compare the function, select the appearance, and look at the demand point: It is not that the more functions the better, many functions may not be used by themselves, so it is necessary to measure their own needs and make comparisons.  Know if you have a passion for a particular brand / system?  Or do you need to take a clearer picture?  Or is it more smooth to play games without fever?  Or do you need the latest 5G phone?  Or do you need to be waterproof and anti-falling?  Or a big battery?  Know what your needs are and sort them in order of importance.  4.  Look at the configuration: To buy a mobile phone, you need to pay attention to CPU type, memory capacity, memory, screen size, camera, battery capacity, etc., and choose the highest configuration for the demand point you are most concerned about at the same price.	126.02114396449178

If you know what features you want you can get a phone with all the latest features and functionalities if that’s what you’re looking for.  Or if you’re looking for a basic cell phone knowing what features you want ahead of time will help you to avoid spending too much money.  It will prevent you from buying a more expensive phone which has lots of features that you don’t want.  Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.  It would be better for you to get a smaller phone.  Display Screen: OnePlus 7 LCD The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen on cell phones has gotten better over the years.	123.50463584763928

The only requirements are that the phone should be unlocked, not specific to a particular carrier, and it should be compatible with GSM Networks.  Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular.  Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone.  Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones.  If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display.  Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers.  Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them.  Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan.  After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward.  Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose.  The least you can pay for the plan is $15 plus an additional $5 for data and unlimited minutes.	181.6077309534885

Here are 10 tips to help you with your next purchase.  1.  Form Follows Function You want to be sure you are purchasing a phone that will deliver all the features and capabilities you want and need.  Rather than think in terms of what you used your last phone for, think instead of what you would like your next phone to be able to do!  If email is important to you, that instantly presents WinMo phones and BlackBerries as options.  If texting is your thing, then a spacious, comfortable keypad is critical.  2.  Get the Best Deal you Can There are more options for purchasing phones today than ever.  Changes in carrier policies and new regulations allow customers to, say, purchase a phone on the internet and bring it to a carrier to have it activated.

Sheridan decides to get the recording to General Hague.  Garibaldi expresses the concern that they might be accused of faking it, but Sheridan tells him that the message will contain the proper ID code to tie the message undeniably to Clark.  Aboard the White Star, the mask reappears and utters a single word – Zog – then disappears.  As the First Ones move away, Ivanova realizes they have denied the request for help.  She refuses to let them leave without saying yes.  Facetiously, Marcus suggests he put a bucket on his head and pretend to be the ancient Vorlon god Booji, which gives Ivanova an idea.  She calls the First Ones back and thanks them for trying but she was warned by the Vorlons that they'd give up without trying.  She tells them that the Vorlons claimed that they carried the other First Ones in the last war.  Impressed by her audacity, the mask returns to inform them in English that when the time is right, she need only call their name and they will come.	238.49886485119896

MARCO_22_1749042451-6	Motorola Moto G7 Power If you want something more affordable, cheaper, but has the latest in Android and that comes with 5000mAh of battery, then the Motorola Moto G7 Power is an excellent phone to consider. With an ANSI rating of M4/T3, not only that you’ll get the latest in Android, but you’ll also get a phone that has better HAC ratings than Google’s flagship phone and all of that for less than USD$300 SRP.  So if you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t break the bank, something of the latest but not necessarily the best, then we highly recommend considering the Moto G7 Power.  5.  Samsung Galaxy A10e If you want an Android smartphone that’s cheaper, more affordable, and you still find the Moto G7 Power a bit off your budget, then we highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy A10e.  This phone has an ANSI rating of M3/T3 with an SRP of USD $179.99.  In some countries, it is being sold for under 100 which is by far the cheapest Samsung phone with the latest Android OS to date.

MARCO_33_97721069-6	Poor camera performance is to be expected with phones in this price range, but last year's Moto G7 phones could usually provide sharper photos in our testing. Should you buy it?  Samsung Galaxy A10e 7.5 / 10 Maybe.  I definitely enjoyed using the Galaxy A10e, thanks to its smaller physical size, great battery life, and lightweight design.  The software experience is very close to what you'd get on Samsung's $1,000+ flagship smartphones, and performance was acceptable.  It also works on all major US carriers, which is missing from Nokia's budget phones.  However, the lack of NFC support and a fingerprint sensor might be deal-breakers for some people.  As previously mentioned, Motorola is now selling phones for less money than the Galaxy A10e that have fingerprint sensors and full support for all US carriers — though you still won't get NFC for contactless payments.  The Galaxy A10e also has an extremely poor camera, but you won't get anything significantly better from the competition at this price range.  Buy it if: You want a Galaxy phone, but your budget is around $200.  Your priorities are hardware/software performance and battery life.  Don't buy it if: You take a lot of photos.  You need NFC support or a fingerprint scanner.	325.60361796296365

We compare Samsung's cheapest and most expensive new models to find out By Louise Muyanja 20 Sep 2019 Share this page Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email One of the smartphones in the image above costs almost £1,000 more than the other.  On one side, the new A10 has had a facelift, with a sleeker design and larger display.  It costs just £140, which stands in stark contrast to the S10 5G’s eye-watering £1,099 price.  Previously, avoiding the lower end of the price spectrum could be excused if you weren’t a fan of chunky-looking smartphones with small screens and thick bezels.  But cheap phones no longer bear the look of ‘you get what you pay for’.  So what’s happening on the insides that can truly justify the extra cost?

90	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_76429195-3	The Moto G7 has a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the affordable sticker price. A 6.2-inch Full HD+ display ensures all of your apps, games, and more look sharp and colorful, and the dual 12MP + 5MP rear camera combo takes pretty good photos all things considered.  You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10.  Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app).  And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers.  We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.

Just like the G7 Power, the G7 also has the excellent Moto Display for quickly seeing notifications without turning on the entire screen, as well as Moto Actions for doing things like chopping the phone to turn on the flashlight or twisting it for opening the camera.  Software updates are also a concern here just like they are with the G7 Power, but we'd expect to see an Android 10 update here before it arrives on the Power sibling.  Pros: Glass design is really sleek Large, sharp display Dual rear cameras Storage is expandable up to 512GB Moto Display and Moto Actions are excellent Cons: Motorola's track record for software updates Performance is fine Best Mid-Ranger Moto G7 The best mid-range phone for TracFone.

It has nice, vibrant colors and acceptable viewing angles, and the touch responsiveness is similarly excellent.  My only complaint is a bit of ghosting while scrolling, but it's not severe enough to be a distraction.  The screen also works wonders for my still-favorite-after-all-these-years Motorola-only feature, Moto Display, which somehow has yet to be surpassed by any competitor's always-on display.  This feature debuted in 2013 and has barely changed in six years, and yet because it was so thoughtfully designed even back then it's stood the test of time.  Remarkable.  The G7 is also really well made.  There's no metal to be found in the frame here, but that's no detriment thanks to whatever grippy resin has been installed over the polycarbonate.  The front and back are adorned with Gorilla Glass 3, which may not be as scratch resistant as the modern variants, but it'll do the job unless you smash the thing to bits on concrete (a situation few phones can actually survive).  I'm also impressed with the design."	95.79779629409312

Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7.  For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.  The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	389.3890300404673

Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	359.9514554936759

In low light, the A50 brightens and punches up colors, while photos taken with the G7 are muddier with much hazier and washed out colors.  The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7.  I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.  The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame.  This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

MARCO_43_1625245214-4	"Another thing that I've done that has been really helpful for time management is using an app called Focus Time. I do a 20- to 35-minute sprint timed with Focus Time in the morning before the kids are even up.  When I get back from that, I pick the biggest work task of the day that I want to get accomplished, and get to it.  The most important aspects of life for me are health and family, so I focus on getting those managed well because when that is done, everything else naturally falls into place.  You have to decide what aspects of life and business are most important to you, get them running smoothly and allow your forward movement to fall into place.  5.  Approach every day as a school day.  When I coach entrepreneurs, I tell them, ""Fail forward and fail fast, and every day will be a school day.""  What that means is that there is always a lesson to be had and failure is one of our greatest teachers.  You have to be open to every experience as an opportunity to learn something new.  The faster and harder you fail, the less and less afraid you become of it because you have come out on the other side of it and are usually stronger and better equipped for it."	198.39044534053392

He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"".  Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin.  Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.  I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being.  ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody.  All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run.  I run in a void.  Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void...  ""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [  clouds].  What I should be looking at is inside me."	192.34578508211416

MARCO_23_1679971784-9	Run At The Same Time Every Day The easiest way to make sure you stick to your new running habit is to do it at the same time every day. Whether its first thing in the morning (my preference), or after work (great for stress relief), sticking to a routine makes it easier to follow through with your activity every day.  The last thing you want is to run out of time and willpower on a given day, and end up skipping a day.  Knowing exactly what you want will help you get it.  4.  Keep a Daily Log Whether it’s a calendar or large notebook, take the time to jot down how far you ran each day and how your run went.  Write what you want to improve tomorrow.  Evaluating your run and making plans for future runs will grow your excitement to get out again tomorrow.  The simple act of crossing off each day on a calendar after you complete your 3 miles is shown to build the habit and make it more likely you’ll stick to your routine.  5. Invite a Friend If you’re worried about the quality friend time you’ll have to shave out of your schedule, invite a friend to join your journey.	182.28291275000083

MARCO_31_951513314-15	Whether you need to carry your iPhone when running to map the terrain, listen to music, or attend phone calls on the go, you can’t carry it in your hand. One slip and the glass sandwich will break from both sides, or the distraction could make things worse and lead to an accident.  The most common option would be carrying the iPhone in the pocket of your shorts, but the constant bounce can kill your rhythm, even it does just jump out of the pocket during the run.  Unless you’re wearing a running vest or a sports bra that comes with a slip pouch to place your device, your best bet is to get a running armband for iPhone.

MARCO_50_1012198764-7	FEEL - This has become quite an important factor nowadays, since phones are no more used only to make calls or send texts. iPhones admittedly look great and for some it well justifies the premium they might pay for it.  So if looks do matter to you, get an iPhone.  It doesn't disappoint.  Design isn't perfect by me, but it definitely looks elegant.  2  . Integration - The Apple ecosystem is very seamlessly integrated.  Say, for example, you're browsing something on your iPhone, it gets synced through iCloud.  You can continue to browse that webpage on ANY other Apple device that you own.  This is just an example.  I know there are phones that have this feature but it's the execution part that Apple has done perfectly.  If you don't own any other Apple device, well, backups and all are still very seamless.  3.  Camera - iPhones have one of the best cameras in the market.  One of the, not THE BEST CAMERA (S7 has a better one).  So you'll definitely not be disappointed by the camera performance.	351.2996065640273

Frost Android is a platform that uses the open source operating system, Linux.  It was first introduced as a smartphone platform in 2008 but has since been integrated into computers, tablets and a wealth of mobile devices.  It would be impractical to list every Android phone in existence, not only due to the huge array of varieties but also because virtually any phone can be an Android phone.  The nature of an open source platform is the ability to customize.  There are, however, a few phones that are more popular than others.

MARCO_06_1823564873-6	First: Windows Phone is the best operating system for a smartphone newbie, someone who wants a simple smartphone that is easy to use and that can make calls, check email and surf the Internet. This person doesn’t download a lot of apps or need to customize his or her phone or unlock it or anything: He or she just wants the basics of the smartphone in a beautiful, simple package.  That’s the meat-and-potatoes Windows Phone market, the shoppers who should most seriously be looking at Windows Phones.  Others who should be looking at Windows Phone include those with Hotmail accounts and those who do lots of work with Microsoft software.  Those who value strong, clean design and hipness in their gadgets might also consider Windows Phone.  It’s still difficult, however, for me to recommend Windows Phone over Android or iOS.  This might change in a year, but right now the iPhone and especially Android just offer a far more robust, complete set of features and applications for buyers.  Windows Phone — despite its splendid aesthetics and smooth operation — feels about a year away from being truly on level with Android and iPhone for a heavy smartphone user.	188.4149513071752

Windows phone failed for different reasons.  I looked at android phones a couple years ago.  It sucked.  I only saw a cluttered screen with every possible color in the world jammed in the home screen.  I used briefly a couple android tablets.  Felt like junk.  IPhone I used superficially.  Interface was better than android.  This article’s first reason is choices, choices and choices.  And that reason itself killed android from my list.  Who said too many choices is a good thing.  Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision.  A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me.  IPhone did that.  People don’t grow fans out of thin air.  There has to be stuff backing it.  Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years.  Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized.  So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones.  Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.  I am yet to test both phones but I am leaning towards IPhone.	170.66170108871302
114	134_3-5	That’s more about phones than mobile platforms.	MARCO_17_930919582-8	These platforms also eclipsed the popularity of smartphone platforms historically aimed towards enterprise markets, such as BlackBerry. There has been an industry shift from feature phones (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume sales, to high-end flagship smartphones, which also enjoy higher margins, thus manufacturers find high-end smartphones much more lucrative than feature phones.  The shift away from feature phones has forced mobile network operators to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling-prices of flagship smartphones have had a negative effect on the mobile network operators, who have seen their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer feature phones.  To help make up for this, carriers typically use high-end devices to upsell customers onto higher-priced service plans with increased data allotments.  Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that include newer features and technology, and that smartphones were considered to be more relevant in present-day popular culture than feature phones.	226.86694505624476

Alright, alright, calm yourselves, keyboard warriors, we know this is something most of you would probably not agree with because let’s face it, with over 80 percent of smartphone market share in the world, the Android mobile operating system leads the rest of the competition by a mile.  Perhaps because it is the OS adopted by many leading brands of smartphones, fragmentation becomes an issue that plagues Android-powered phone.  Here is a post by Azzief Khaliq that argues for and against the effects of Android OS fragmentation you should check out.

117	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	310.2104555953101

Learn about our Review Board John Honerkamp Updated on March 18, 2021 Are you ready to start running again?  Maybe you took a break because of an injury, a lack of motivation, or work responsibilities that demanded your time.  It can be daunting to get back into running after taking time off, but returning to running is achievable, and with the right plan and a little patience, you can get on back on track with your training schedule.  If you've only been sidelined briefly, it is fairly easy to come back from a short running break (such as a week or two).  But if you've taken several weeks or months off of running, it's important to ease back into your routine carefully to avoid injury and frustration.	249.7695678969576
119	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_51_964601708-3	Here's what to do during your break. Make it last.  Take at least one three- or four-week break each year.  Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training.  Time it right.  The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes.  Stay in shape.  During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times.  For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started).  Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do.  For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout.  The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity.  In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness.  You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.	249.7523713861192
120	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_52_483672706-4	Any kind of strength training. Cool Down For Running After running, a good cool down can be a brisk walk for 2-3 minutes, gradually tapering your pace or stroll.  Sprinting is the same concept, but start with jogging, then taper down to walking.  This will be followed by static stretches that aim to increase the range of motion and flexibility of your lower body.  Start with standing stretches, then seated stretches.  As you can see, it’s a gradual pace to bring your body down to normal levels and relaxation.  Cool Down for Resistance & Strength Training After resistance training, you will want to do a mobility cool down routine.  This involves gentle bodyweight movements and stretching.  It’s like a yoga flow, where you move in an out of movements, holding stretches for 5-10 seconds (although you can hold stretches longer if you want, as after a workout it is fine).  We have an example of this kind of routine further below (see 4-Min Cool Down Routine).  Note: Make sure you emphasize stretches for areas you worked most in your workout.  So, if it was an upper body day, focus on your upper body more.  If it was a full body day, you can do an evenly targeted full body cool down.	154.24649684876204
121	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_50_2479500095-10	Walking The creme de la creme of cool down exercises, according to our research, is walking. It doesn’t matter what kind of work out you do; taking a nice walk afterwards always seems to be toward the top of all the lists.  2  . Stretch those legs While this mostly applies to runners, a great cool down exercise is stretching your legs.  This includes all the classics like pulling your leg up behind you to stretch your hamstring or trying to touch your toes.  There are other, more complex stretches that more or less stretch the same areas.  3  . Stretch your chest A few of our cool down exercise choices will be stretching.  This is just a heads up because they’re very effective for cooling down and they’re all pretty easy to do.  A popular one is lacing your fingers behind your back, straightening out your arms and looking at the ceiling.  This is effective at stretching your chest muscles.  4. Stretch your arms If you’ve ever noticed, even runners stretch their arms before they go running.  Consequently, it’s also one of the more effective cooldown exercises.  It helps to get your shoulders and your arms loosened up.  5.  Stretch out your core The core of your body is often something that gets overlooked in both stretching and exercise in general.	131.17037187796086
122	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_50_2479500095-11	So it’s not only great to include in your cool down exercises but also recommended since your core is, well, your core. 6.  Jumping jacks Now we get back into lighter exercises that also work well for cool down exercises.  A favourite is a jumping jack. 7.  Swimming If you have access to a pool at your home or your gym, a quick dip in the pool can be great for cooldowns. 8.  Get a Massage Okay, this one doesn't exercise on the face of it, but it can be effective as many cool down exercises.  The point of cool down exercises is to transition your body from exerting to rest.  Part of that is getting rid of pooled blood left over from when your veins and arteries pumping blood the body didn’t need anymore. 9.  Exercise specific drills This one is a little complex but bear with me.  If you’re a runner, you’ll obviously be working out your legs most of all.  So doing some squats after a run keeps your legs pumping without the stress of actually running.  These can be wonderful cooldown exercises. 10.  Exercise mimicry Now I’m getting into the complicated sounding stuff.  Oddly enough, it’s still not that complicated.	127.50186612457036

Buy thicker bands There are some ways to find out high-quality resistance bands, and the best way is considering the thickness of the band.  Usually, high-quality resistance bands are much thicker, and the bands feel fuller when they are squeezed.  Whatever, for those who would not fear to spend some extra money on good quality bands, we would definitely recommend the thicker resistant bands.  Final Verdict As we have already stated about the resistance bands one by one, now it is time for you to take a sensible decision and go for the right option.

(Types and Product Recommendation)  In the Resistance Band Workout above, Coach Matt showed you how to handle two types of resistance bands: loop bands and tube bands.  Let’s go over these and other resistance bands you may come across.  #1) Loop Bands Much like the name would suggest, loop resistance bands consist of one single band formed in a loop.  They don’t have handles and are more strap-like than chord-like.  Not only can you use these in the exercises covered above but you can also use them to help perform bodyweight exercises like assisted pull-ups or assisted bodyweight dips.  You can check out our guide The 42 Best Bodyweight Exercises for more on this topic.  At the time of this writing, there were still some loop bands available for purchase online.  #2) Tube Bands Tube resistance bands will often have handles or carabiners at the end (which you can attach a handle or anchor to).  You might also hear these called “fit tubes.”  As Coach Matt showed you, every exercise in our Resistance Band Workout can be done with a tube band, so they’re ideal for creating a home gym .	114.15940408036111

MARCO_34_1286244718-7	However, as you get more and more advanced, this type of scenario won't work nearly as well since you're sending multiple mixed messages to your body. Monday's workout would tell your body it's time to get big, but then Wednesday's workout will kick your body into a bit of strength mode.  Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength.  What is a confused body to do?!  As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training).  It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances.  While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time.  The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.

129	135_3-1	Okay. Are there better calorie-burning exercises to try asides from running?	MARCO_10_1406412858-2	But to be honest, taking a spin class isn’t the only fast track to a leaner, fitter bod. “There are other classes and workouts that can be better ways to burn calories,” says Isabel Smith, R.D., C.D.N., celebrity dietitian and fitness expert.  “It’s all about what type of workout will push you to work harder and raise your heart rate higher.”  If you’re thinking of hopping off the iron horse and trying something new, consider these five cal-crushing alternatives for an even more rewarding sweat sesh.

130	135_3-1	Okay. Are there better calorie-burning exercises to try asides from running?	MARCO_01_1154692318-3	Bike Longer Polka Dot Images/Polka Dot/Getty Images Another factor that makes cycling a better calorie-burning activity than running or swimming is that you can do it for longer. Since cycling doesn't have the high impact of running and has built-in rests, reasonably fit cyclists can ride for a long time, burning more total calories.  For example, our 130-pound woman would burn about 2,600 calories running a four-hour marathon.  Conversely, if she biked a six-hour century (100 miles), she would burn 4,250 calories--an extra 1,650 calories--for a similar effort.  Tips to Burn More Calories Polka Dot Images/Polka Dot/Getty Images The best thing you can do to burn more calories over time is to ride often.  You burn calories faster if you ride hard.  You can't ride hard every day, but schedule a few rides a week where you pick up the pace by pushing a harder gear, spinning at a higher cadence or riding uphill until you're sucking wind.  These kinds of workouts also take more energy (calories) for recovery.	148.0157089731074

It is the best fat-burning substitution for grapefruit.  But, don’t include oranges as they give the opposite results.  6.Is there any better alternatives for Banana in the Military Diet?  Banana has been recommended on almost all three days of the military diet.  But, if you don’t like it, then you can substitute 1 whole banana with either a cup of Papaya or 2 kiwis or 2 apricots.  So, that makes ½ banana replaceable with ½ cup of papaya, 1 kiwi or 1 apricot.  7.Broccoli Alternatives on the 3 day diet The best substitute for broccoli are green vegetables such as: – Spinach – Asparagus – Brussel sprouts – Cauliflower 8.Substitute for Saltine Crackers in 3 Day Military Diet Each saltine cracker gives you around 13 calories.

132	135_3-3	I don’t have an indoor bike and neither am I great at skiing. What good alternative to running is there asides from indoor cycling and cross-country skiing?	MARCO_18_2943050931-5	Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.  Environmental impacts See also: Environmental impact of tourism and Vegetation and slope stability The process of resort development have progressed since the birth of the skiing industry.  As the economic role of the skiing industry grew, the environmental impact of resort development has also caused environmental burdens on the natural ecosystem including mountain water levels of lakes, streams, and wildlife.	184.42594404597912

Grass Skiing Grass skiing can be done on most slopes – the essential thing (besides knowing what you’re doing and having the slope owner’s permission) is the grass ski – a kind of skate with mini tank-tracks on its base with which you ‘ski’ over dry grass, down a slope.  Grass skiing was invented by Richard Martin in Germany in 1966 and has spread around the world with enthusiasts in many countries, perhaps in particular Japan and Iran.

MARCO_12_601122339-15	A jump rope like the one linked above is ideal for all sorts of exercises, and can be done indoors (if you have a high enough ceiling) or outdoors, depending on your needs. A jump rope also takes up very little space when not in use.

136	135_3-5	I suppose I could do jumping rope or kickboxing, but I like the outdoors and would like to work out there.	MARCO_29_576504017-2	Jump rope is notoriously popular among boxers, but might as well be among swimmers too. Jumping rope is a simple dryland cardio workout which is great for improving foot speed, agility, coordination, and shoulder strength, all while burning a ton of calories.  Another huge bonus of this dryland cardio workout is the fact that it’s straightforward, cheap, and easily accessible.  You don’t need a lot of space to jump rope and it can be done practically anywhere.  Personally, I like to do some jump rope before getting in the water to help warm up and activate my muscles.  Something as simple as 5 minutes of jumping rope is a great way to warm up the body and ensure that you don’t get injured in the pool.  An additional benefit of jumping rope is the fact that this is very low impact on the body, similar to swimming.  Jumping rope doesn’t place a lot of stress on the joints and is easy to recover from after a workout.  If you want to incorporate this into your training regimen as a dryland cardio workout I recommend doing interval jumping, similar to interval training in the pool.  Do 1-2 minutes of continuous skipping and then rest 30 seconds.	130.75759193394333

Always warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting any exercise.  Jump rope Equipment: gym shoes (sneakers), jump rope Benefits: Jumping rope helps develop better body awareness, hand-foot coordination, and agility.  Safety: Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height.  Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits.  That’s the height you’re going for.  If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope.  Duration and frequency: 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space.  Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete.  If you’re a beginner: Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet.  Do this move for 15 seconds.  Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope.  Do this move for 15 seconds.  Finish your set by doing a hopscotch jump for 15 seconds.	130.3510966084432
138	135_4-1	I live in a flat on the third floor. How do I do jump rope at home?	MARCO_45_1163802455-8	Second Mindfulness Exercise: Concentration The second exercise is that while you breathe in, you follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end. If your in-breath lasts three or four seconds, then your mindfulness also lasts three or four seconds.  Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through.  Breathing out, I follow my out-breath all the way through.  From the beginning of my out-breath to the end of my out-breath, my mind is always with it.  Therefore, mindfulness becomes uninterrupted, and the quality of your concentration is improved.  So the second exercise is to follow your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through.  Whether they are short or long, it doesn’t matter.  What is important is that you follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end.  Your awareness is sustained.  There is no interruption.  Suppose you are breathing in, and then you think, “Oh, I forgot to turn off the light in my room.”  There is an interruption.  Just stick to your in-breath all the way through.  Then you cultivate your mindfulness and your concentration.  You become your in-breath.  You become your out-breath.	284.41390163381584

The challenge here is to start rotating it.  See every detail, but from all angles.  If you feel comfortable, begin to bring in some surroundings.  Place it on an imaginary table.  Shine a few lights on it and imagine the shadows flickering.  3 rd Exercise This third exercise builds on the second, and can be hard for some people, although others will find it very easy.  This time, recreate your little object, but with your eyes open.  See it in the real world, right in front of you.  Again, move it around, rotate it, play with it.  See how it interacts with the objects in front of you.  Imagine it resting on your keyboard, casting a shadow on your mouse, or knocking over your coffee cup.  4 th Exercise This is where things start to get fun.

Simply remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and not any fad diet that you may find.  1.  Eat Healthy and Regularly Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight.  Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses.  Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals.  Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat.  If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.  The easiest way to adopt these changes is to prepare your food yourself, and staying mindful of what exactly you are eating.  2. Increase Protein Intake An important component of any weight loss diet is protein.	133.64992030058056

MARCO_51_971491333-3	“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.	286.1924027218124

MARCO_46_567135259-6	To boost your metabolism you can also try drinking green tea in the morning (check the post for more details.) Health benefits of running in the morning empty stomach The main benefits of running on an empty stomach in the morning are – your body becomes capable of burning more fat than running after a meal.  Its because in the morning time our body sugar level stays low.  And to supply energy for the run/workout our body uses fat as an energy source.  Reference from health.harvard.edu After eating a meal, you have to wait for some time before you can run or exercise.  Running before breakfast solves the issue.  But you can drink coffee or tea 10 -15 minutes before you run.  And, after running, you can have your regular breakfast.  Another good reason to run before breakfast is – you will be hungry for your breakfast.  Also, eating a nutritional breakfast in the morning means your body will get the required energy so, you can tackle difficult tasks with ease during the day.  All the other benefits are more or less the same as running after breakfast/ running in the morning.  Things to know if you want to run after breakfast If you want to run for long in the morning then its a good idea to complete your breakfast then go for a run after some time.	221.54340004975077

154	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_51_971491333-4	Training duration and intensity are severely restricted by the lack of glycogen. Therefore, the intended training stimulus is rather low.  A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance.  Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores.  This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism.  The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles.  However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance.  At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health.  Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training.  This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast.  So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes.  Choose a low intensity (at a recovery run or conversation pace).  You should drink a glass of water before your run.	201.4602738221729
155	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_09_18864409-2	When we exercise, the opposite occurs; blood flow is redirected from internal organs to the large working muscles to provide the necessary energy for muscle contraction. When we have a large amount of food in our stomach, running is difficult or uncomfortable because our body is simply not designed to do both digestion and exercise at the same time.  Stomach cramps, stomach aches, or gastro-intestinal distress are the most common complaints when trying to run on a full stomach.  The mechanical mixing and jostling that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract too.  Now that said, some athletes are able to eat and run.  Endurance athletes train their bodies to eat on the run.  Even at the marathon distance, runners must ingest some nutrition during the race, although hardly a large meal.  Experimenting in your training with eating and running will let you know just how much you are able to eat before a run.  For the best training results though, allow three to four hours after eating before running, especially if the workout calls for some intensity.  All the best, Susan Paul, MS	196.95451258971295

Take a break if you start to feel lightheaded.  The exception is if you’re running a long distance or doing a high-intensity run.  These activities require a lot of energy, so it’s wise to eat before.  Healthy snacks before and after running If you do want to eat before a run, choose a light snack.  Focus on healthy carbs.  Eat your snack 1 to 3 hours before running.  Ideal pre-workout snacks include: whole grain cereal whole wheat toast banana apple yogurt granola bar without added sugars After running, eat lean protein and healthy carbs within 2 hours.  These nutrients will support muscle recovery and replenish your glycogen stores.  Examples of good post-workout meals include: turkey sandwich with whole wheat bread and vegetables oatmeal and peanut butter yogurt and fruit salmon with avocado and quinoa fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt and nut butter Also, drink water before, during, and after your run.

MARCO_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.  It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	169.73608368408168

MARCO_01_1448508478-1	Significance Of The Watergate Scandal Significance Of The Watergate Scandal    Significance Of The Watergate Scandal The Watergate Scandal took place when Richard Nixon was the president and it led to the indictment of many advisors of the president.  It was because of the scandal that Nixon was forced to resign on August 9th, 1974.  The significance of the Watergate Scandal was immense.  The scandal broke out because of break in that occurred in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee on June 17th 1972.  A total of 5 burglars were arrested and further investigation revealed that the burglars and some advisors of the president were involved in conspiracy and illegal wiretapping.  Also, it was found out that the involved men were either directly or indirectly employed by the president's Committee to Reelect the President.  The significance of the Watergate Scandal is as follows: The US Congress decided to curtail the power of the president when it came to deployment of troops, money matters and freedom of information.  With the impeachment proceedings that began against Richard Nixon, it was shown to the Americans and the rest of the world that no person was above the law.  The scandal put an end to Nixon's political career, and left his reputation in tatters.  The Freedom of Information Act was further strengthened and this allowed people to get easier access to government-related documents.	143.15925629314734

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell.  At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty.  G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison.  Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC).  Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.  In it, he claimed that high White House officials had pressured the defendants to plead guilty.  The five who pleaded had perjured themselves at the urging of “higher-ups.”	145.71558642336458

No one in the White House had been implicated.  And Nixon won the election by a huge margin.  The Cover-Up Unravels Two months after the election, Watergate came back into public view.  Reporters at the Washington Post were uncovering links between the White House and the Watergate break-in.  The burglars who had not pleaded guilty—Liddy and McCord—went on trial on January 10, 1973, before Judge John Sirica.  The jury found them both guilty.  New doubts were raised when FBI Director Gray testified that Dean had sat in when Watergate witnesses were being interviewed and that he had turned over the FBI’s Watergate files to Dean.  The cover-up continued behind the scenes with Nixon’s knowledge and approval.  In a meeting on March 22, 1973, in the Oval Office with Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell and Dean present, Ehrlichman told Dean to say that nobody in the White House was involved, and Nixon chimed in: “That’s right.”  They discussed using executive privilege to limit questioning.

Nixon had microphones in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, his Executive Office Building office and the Aspen Lodge at Camp David, and also recorded phone calls in the Lincoln Sitting Room.  After the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes to Congress in the summer of 1974, prosecutors found they corroborated Dean’s testimony and implicated the president in the cover-up.  “  [  Dean] was first and one of the only, actually, in the higher echelons to give honest testimony,” Robenalt says.  “Other people who testified, including the chief of staff and the attorney general, they all went to jail for lying about what was going on.”  Dean made a deal where he received a reduced sentence for providing key witness testimony and pleading guilty to obstruction of justice.  He served four months in prison and was disbarred from practicing law in D.C. and Virginia.  Still, some of the higher-level Watergate conspirators didn’t actually get a much harsher punishments than Dean.  Former Attorney General John Mitchell and former Chief of Staff H.R.

170	136_1-7	Did Congress and federal prosecution get Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office?	WAPO_OCLL7TWVP5ALVIKWIOSHRUVCCU-5	Nixon famously asserted executive privilege to block the release of tapes capturing his coverup of the Watergate scandal, defying a congressional subpoena ordering him to turn most of them over. The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.  At first, he gave Congress 19 tapes — but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.  In a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him.  “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said on April 29, 1974.  He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove “irrelevant” information that was not subject to Congress’s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns and promising that the rest would be sufficient.  But to House leaders, it wasn’t.  Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said that “we will accept nothing less” than the tapes — and months later, they got them.  In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon’s claims of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes.	124.57373112123788

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.  The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	186.01359401010268

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.  It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.	254.5481658888748

MARCO_02_337202498-76	"Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that ""Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships both with Communist China and with the Soviet Union.""  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  In surveys of historians and political scientists, Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president.  During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate.  Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks restored the president's power.  Personality and public image Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it.  Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred."	187.2127592046745

On June 17, 1972, The Washington Post published a small story.  In this story, the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.  The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate.  These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers.  The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deeply into the story.  Their names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward; they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime.  The reporters suspected that the break-in had been ordered by other White House officials.  In a press conference in August of 1972, President Nixon said that nobody in the White House staff was involved in the crime.  Most of the public accepted Nixon’s word and dropped the investigation.	127.12547721981537

Just after midnight on June 17, 1972, five burglars were caught red-handed by plainclothes D.C. policemen in the offices of the Democratic National Committee.  When they were arrested, the middle-aged, suit-clad bandits held sophisticated communications and surveillance electronics, as well as large amounts of cash.  Advertisement The building in northwest Washington that held the DNC's national headquarters was the relatively new Watergate office and hotel complex.  Although virtually no one knew it at the time, the seemingly small-time burglary started a ticking time bomb that ultimately exploded the presidency of Richard M. Nixon .  RELATED UPI Almanac for Saturday, June 17, 2017 The Break-In The five burglars -- James McCord, Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martínez and Frank Sturgis -- forced their way into the Watergate complex and DNC offices around midnight on the 16th to replace failing bugging equipment that had been installed there two weeks earlier.	119.54970875881554

198	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	MARCO_14_1571463715-3	Bostrom   points   out   that   the   only   way   we   could   be   sure   is   if   a   message   popped   up    in   front   of   our   eyes   saying:   “You   are    living   in   a   computer   simulation.”   Or,    he   says,   if   the   operators   transported   you   to   their   reality   (which,   of   course,   may   itself   be   a   simulation).  Although   we   are   unlikely   to   get   proof,   we   might   find   some   hints   about   our   reality.    “I   think   it   might   be   feasible   to   get   evidence   that   would   at   least   give   weak   clues,”   says   Bostrom.  Economist   Robin   Hanson   of   George   Mason   University   in   Fairfax,   Virginia,    is   not   so   sure.	133.76589436945503
199	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	MARCO_31_719719292-4	This principle, when applied to the case of simulation, says that the probability that we are living in a simulated world instead of a real one is equal to the fraction of all people that are actually simulated people. By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.  Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument.  However, this isn’t quite accurate.	128.80131669389084

We will have no way of knowing that we live in a simulation because we will never reach the technological capacity to realize the marks of a simulated reality.  Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.  If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.  Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation.  For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: ""You are living in a simulation.

MARCO_56_715074680-1	What is the Multiverse Theory? - Universe Today Posted on November 5, 2010 July 21, 2020 by Matt Williams What is the Multiverse Theory?  If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes.  The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically.  Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy.  In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.  In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own.  The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James.  However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	227.30640217643304

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in.  Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory.  For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering.  What Is It?  The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience.  These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously.  These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.”  What are These Parallel Universes?  These parallel universes, also called “braneworlds” by some, hover just beyond your reach.	210.34328198840376

Multiverse Theory The multiverse theory is one of the leading arguments about the origins of the Universe.  According to it, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of whom is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  The grid of Universes is known as a Multiverse, where each bubble, after springing into existence, expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light.  According to the Multiverse Theory, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of which is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  (Photo Credit: Silver Spoon / Wikimedia Commons)  This whimsical theory is corroborated by the CMBR and the theory of inflation, where the former is an indisputable proof of the Big Bang and the latter is a compelling explanation for the Universe’s homogeneity.  However, conclusive evidence has yet to come to light.  The theory essentially explores what might have existed before the Big Bang, a question that cannot be answered right now, as it requires knowledge of singularities, which we don’t yet fully possess, as mentioned earlier.	162.6046771257537

MARCO_14_729492685-3	Image via Disney/Marvel That’s where the driving plot of Infinity War comes in, which co-director Joe Russo describes as a heist movie of sorts: “He’s on a hunt. We’re using a bit of a ’90s heist genre component.  Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.”  So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him.  Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power.  We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great.  This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies.  Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	222.73068745170167

MARCO_36_99529317-9	Marvel fans — and really, fans in general — are so imaginative they’re often making up their own movies by coming up with “ fan theories .” They like to guess what might happen in a future movie and see if they can be a step or two ahead of the filmmakers.  Other times they’re trying to fill in what they perceive as plot holes.  Whatever the reasons for their creation, fan theories are sometimes bizarre or even nonsensical — but sometimes, for all their nuttiness, they can be rather brilliant.  We found a Ranker list of Marvel theories that are so out there, we actually want many of them to be true.  Sometimes they even are.  1.  Spider-Man was in ‘Iron Man 2’ Tom Holland | Han Myung-Gu/WireImage This theory sits at the top of the list for a very good reason — it actually turned out to be true.  Iron Man 2 was the third MCU movie, and it had a scene where a very young boy encounters a drone and is saved by Tony at the last second.  Tom Holland later confirmed that was indeed Peter Parker.  What makes this all the more impressive/strange is that Iron Man 2 came out in 2010, when Sony still had full control of the character.	150.0706384535588

Here are ideas on how to build self-esteem in your teens.  Spend Time With Your Teen When you spend time with your teens, you are communicating that they are important, which goes a long way in developing self-esteem.  Additionally, spending time together allows you to build a solid relationship.  That foundation becomes extremely important as they face more and more challenges.  Kids who know their parents love them unconditionally will fair much better when life gets tough than kids who feel like an afterthought in their parents' lives.  Encourage Your Teen to Pursue Their Passions When teens have areas in their lives where they feel confident, this attitude will carry over into other areas of life, reducing the likelihood that they will be bullied.  Any enjoyable activity your child excels in will build confidence.  Help your teens draw on their strengths and find something they enjoy.  Then, help her pursue these passions.  Allow Your Teen to Make Mistakes Encourage your teens to take reasonable risks and try not to shelter them or rescue them from life's setbacks.  Allow your teen to experience setbacks and disappointments without feeling a sense of failure.	121.9554762064945
210	138_1-3	How do I build my son's self-esteem when criticism is unavoidable?	MARCO_47_578522580-4	Teenagers often take criticism as ridicule or shame. At times, when criticism is unavoidable, watch your tone.  4.  Encourage Extra Curricular Activities: Let your teenager follow his hobbies.  Encourage him to participate in more and more activities.  It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys.  Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence.  These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal.  [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5.  Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make.  Teach him about respect and acceptance.  Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important.  Teach him that value is what matters between friends.  The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence.  Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends.  6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure.  To them looks matter a lot.  They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely.  It is important to sit and explain to your teenager that looks do not matter.	367.249837070598

Why even try?”  The motivation to try is lost.  Always be very specific when you are giving negative feedback.  And make sure your criticism is constructive.  Say “Look – this small step in this sum has made the whole answer wrong.  Let me explain the step to you again and then do 10 sums like this.  That will ensure that you will never make this mistake again.”  Do not be grumpy and complaining When teenagers don’t do well in academics – they typically start slipping in other areas of their lives as well.  They start keeping their rooms untidy, they neglect their personal hygiene like taking bath and brushing etc.  They dress untidily in crushed clothes and so on.  This can make you more and more irritated and you may look at your child in disgust whenever she/he is around you and start pointing out everything that is wrong with your child at all times of the day.  Do not do this.  It can be extremely demotivating.  This is the time to support your child and find out why your child is behaving like this with expert help – instead of constantly criticizing her/him.

Your child learns from the way you interact with others so make sure you are a role model for appropriate behavior.  This includes greeting people, being a good listener and practicing self-control.  Help your youngster develop an active social life by having him join clubs, setting up play dates, etc. Assist him in developing conversation skills.  Help him handle difficult behaviors such as teasing and bullying.  Social skills worksheets are unique resources designed from the perspective of children aged 3 – 12, to help them develop good communication skills, support kids experiencing social difficulties and encourage them to find their own solutions.  No matter how responsible, confident or social your child is, social skills worksheets will help him do even better in life by making him more aware of himself and the people around him.	172.64122100629902
214	138_1-5	How do I help to improve my son's social skills?	MARCO_23_808685561-2	One of of the biggest struggles is his lack of social skills. Whether its a lack of personal space, a disregard for other’s feelings, or his inability to be flexible in a situation, my son struggles with everyday life activities that many children don’t have to even think twice about.  In exchange, he often feels isolated, picked on, and singled out.  He struggles with making the connection between socially acceptable behavior and his need for sensory input.  My son is not alone.  In fact, many times children struggle with these same skills and are pinpointed as a bully, the “mean” kid, non-compliant, or defiant.  When the truth is that these children, like my son, are spending so much energy trying to regulate their nervous system, that they do not have anything left for social cues and social “niceties”.  6 Simple Strategies to Teach Social Skills When it Doesn’t Come Easy #1 Educate Yourself The first step in teaching a child who struggles with social skills is to educate yourself on the possible reasons behind their lack of skills.  Is it a behavior management problem, a communication problem, or a problem with sensory integration.	162.10128886323218
215	138_1-5	How do I help to improve my son's social skills?	MARCO_11_8761336-15	Does your son need help expressing emotions appropriately? Are you or your child concerned about his transition into middle school (or high school) and fitting in socially?  Has he been diagnosed with Social Anxiety, Asperger's Syndrome, Autism, or AD/HD?  Does your son shy away from social interactions?  The tween and teen years can be academically and socially challenging for middle school boys.  And some kids need a little extra help learning social skills to make these years a success!  Through a variety of discussions, exercises, role-play, worksheets, videos, and projects, your son will enhance his social skills and improve his self-esteem.

216	138_1-7	Awesome. He cares a lot about looks also. What can I do about that?	MARCO_56_1740186991-5	"And, let's face it, teenagers today place a lot of importance on their looks. It's not vain, it's very age-appropriate.  They're developing their sense of self.  So acne, even breakouts that we consider mild, can be a huge source of embarrassment to teens.  7 ﻿ You know your child better than anyone else, and you know if something is bothering them.  If you notice your teen seems depressed, withdrawn, angry, or just isn't acting like his or herself, start asking why.  Getting acne cleared up can be a huge boost to their self-confidence and self-esteem.  Make it a priority.  7 Your Teen Asks to See a Dermatologist Some teens will come right out and ask to see a dermatologist.  Don't brush them off telling them that all teenagers get acne, or that their acne isn't ""bad enough"" to see a dermatologist.  If your kid is asking, it means acne is really bothering them.  It also means your child is probably feeling overwhelmed and helpless as far as their skin is concerned.  8 ﻿ Not possible to take your teen to a dermatologist?  Your family doctor can treat most cases of acne, too."	256.4374539505516
217	138_1-7	Awesome. He cares a lot about looks also. What can I do about that?	MARCO_32_262190801-3	It makes you too tall or too short, changes your voice, makes you smell like a farm animal, and scrambles your brain like an egg. But trust us when we say this: The less you worry about your looks, the better your acting will be.  So abandon your vanity and dig into the work.  Besides, there are other people who are hired to worry about your looks.  They're called make-up artists, costume designers, and stylists.  Choose appropriate material.  As a teenager, it's so tempting to pick material that is more mature.  But that's a trap.  You might think it makes you look cool or edgy, but it really just calls attention to you.  The bad kind.  As a general rule of thumb, try to appear younger at acting auditions for teens.  Besides, there is so much good material out there written for teenagers!  Exercise.  Don't under-estimate the power of a good workout before you audition.  Not only will it make you look better, it will improve your self-esteem, energize you, and release some feel-good endorphins.  What could be better?  (Just make sure to shower when you're done...)  Involve your parents.  Your parents.	214.9848851558345
218	138_1-7	Awesome. He cares a lot about looks also. What can I do about that?	MARCO_47_578522580-4	Teenagers often take criticism as ridicule or shame. At times, when criticism is unavoidable, watch your tone.  4.  Encourage Extra Curricular Activities: Let your teenager follow his hobbies.  Encourage him to participate in more and more activities.  It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys.  Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence.  These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal.  [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5.  Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make.  Teach him about respect and acceptance.  Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important.  Teach him that value is what matters between friends.  The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence.  Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends.  6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure.  To them looks matter a lot.  They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely.  It is important to sit and explain to your teenager that looks do not matter.	191.58978033399035
219	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_56_1626952454-5	Build Self-Worth If your teen only feels good when they get a certain amount of likes on social media or when they fit into a certain size pants, they'll struggle to maintain confidence when situations don't suit their needs. Basing self-worth on superficial things, external circumstances, or other people leads to a lack of confidence in the long run.  Help your teen build a healthy and stable foundation for self-worth.  Emphasize your values and teach that true self-worth is about living according to those values.  Help them see that it’s more important to be kind and caring rather than thin or attractive.  5 ﻿﻿ Balance Freedom with Guidance Micromanaging your teen’s choices will only reinforce that they can’t be trusted to make good decisions independently.  It’s important to balance just the right amount of freedom with plenty of guidance.  Provide your teen with plenty of opportunities to practice the skills you’ve taught.  Let them experience natural consequences and they'll learn from their own mistakes.  Over time, they'll develop increased confidence in their ability to make healthy choices.  Natural Consequences as an Effective Discipline Tool Help Develop Positive Self-Talk Your teen’s inner monologue will play a major role in how they feel about themselves.	255.1799584835389
220	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life. This might also result in inability to empathize.  These sites make kids prone to sensationalism.  A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall.  Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media.  A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison.  This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence.  However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships.  Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”.  After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody.  Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	230.90554113071948
221	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	WAPO_0af01e9053c7d7eb8df7ea4ebe5c8cb0-5	Social media offers tween and teens a place to make good choices and skin their knees safely as they develop the resilience and confidence needed to navigate their world online and offline. They might not be able to do it alone.  Tweens and teens can use their parents to find positive role models and navigate sticky situations.  If you are involved in your child’s digital life, you can offer suggestions and advice on how to be kind online.  Social media offers kids a place for social change and parents an effective forum to encourage kindness and citizenship.  5. Use social media to present your best self: We all know that your digital footprint starts at birth and that children’s lives are chronicled online.  Teenagers who present their “best self” (not their fake, perfect self) rate higher on measures of self-confidence and self-esteem.  If your teenager has good social skills and self-esteem then social media can help her to feel more connected and more understood.  A teenager’s online life can be become a calling card or portfolio.  Teenagers can showcase their music online or write a fashion blog.  They can design games and write codes with kids from all over the world.  The key is that your online identity must mirror your true identity.	218.85281124748872
222	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_28_1670194773-2	A teen may feel unable to ask for the help that they need. Low self-esteem makes a teen extremely vulnerable.  Depression and anxiety can be hard to spot in teens because of the common stereotype that all teens are moody.  Tools for Understanding Moods and Emotions Give your teen time to process an emotion.  Encourage your teen to be kind to themselves and not to be afraid to feel angry or sad.  Show them these things with your behavior, not just your words.  You are constantly modeling to your teen the way in which emotions like anger, sadness, or frustration are handled.  Provide opportunities for your teen to learn to address emotions.  For example, a therapist for teens could help them to identify the tools that are most useful for them.  This can prevent future depression and anxiety problems, especially if you are already seeing signs like self-deprecating comments or a change in behaviors and habits.  2.  Being Stuck in Negative Thought Patterns Low self-esteem often goes hand-in-hand with excessive worry, anxiety and/or negativity.  Expecting the worst harms your teen’s sense of possibility or capability, creating a negative cycle of thoughts and actions.  For example, your teen may anticipate that a test will go poorly and, as a result, avoid trying or studying.	125.22930247335808
223	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_25_1467599711-5	Positive Affirmations Day – Observe a positive affirmation day at your home once a week for your teenager to feel confident and affable. This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem.  For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts.  Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves.  Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually.  Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth.  Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought.  Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again.  Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem.  The following activity, if practiced regularly, will help your teen reduce the cycle of negative self-talk and make them a more positive person.  This activity is divided into four sections.	124.26865435018316
224	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_13_1743844487-4	Don’t let, “Take the trash out” turn into, “You always forget to do your chores because you’re lazy.” Critical self-talk mirrors messages that we absorb about ourselves in early childhood.  So, change the conversation to overcome issues with self-esteem for teens.  Esteem-Building Tips Besides rewriting the inner dialogue, help your teen take these steps to improve self-worth: Celebrate what they do well.  Focus on effort instead of perfection.  Reframe mistakes into learning opportunities.  Pinpoint trigger thoughts that cause low self-esteem.  Get adventurous and try new things.  Own their decisions and opinions.  Give back to others through volunteering.  Make wise decisions.  Support your teen’s growth and development by being generous with praise.  This doesn’t mean telling your son or daughter that they’re smart or good-looking.  It means diving into specific situations where they performed well (e.g. cleaning their room, getting a B+ on their math test.)  Use this descriptive praise to celebrate good choices and hard work.  Decision Making and Self-Esteem Decision making remains crucial to a teen’s success.  Yet, developing decision-making skills is an often overlooked process.  And it requires practice.  So, find decision-making opportunities and guide your teen through them.	115.59444456732945

Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong.

Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over.  Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure.  The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected.  To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work.

""What a Wonderful World"" was credited to George Douglas or Stanley Clayton.  These are pseudonyms Thiele used, made from the names of his uncles, Stanley, Clayton, George, and Douglas.   In the late 1960s Thiele was often brought in to produce artists on the company's Bluesway Records label.  He produced the albums that graduated B.B.

After seven years with ABC Records, the parent of Impulse!, Thiele formed his own company, Flying Dutchman Productions, in 1968.  Thiele later formed his own record label, Flying Dutchman Records, which is now part of Sony Music Entertainment.

Tran Director : Barry Levinson Motion Picture Rating : R Running Time: 2 hours, 1 minute The film that helped make comedian and actor Robin Williams a household name, Good Morning, Vietnam very loosely chronicles the real-life exploits of Armed Forces Radio Service DJ Adrian Cronauer during the Vietnam War. Rebellious and irreverent, he defies his superiors by playing popular rock music for the troops while simultaneously befriending some of the Vietnamese people his country is at war against.  Good Morning, Vietnam introduced an entire generation of moviegoers to Williams' manic energy and humor, and it's still an effective showcase of the late star's incredible talent.

While Good Morning Vietnam has anti-war and anti-American undertones, Cronauer was completely supportive of the war effort.  Robin Williams’s comedy is completely different from Adrian Cronauer’s: Cronauer was very reserved in his comedic style and stayed mainly within military guidelines.  However, the restaurant bombing incident did occur to a point: while the bombing did occur, and Adrian did notice and bring it up to his boss, he did not go against orders and report the news.  I think this movie was , but not great.  http://books.google.com/books?id=XcuIse9Mp-QC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=beer+with+formaldehyde+vietnam&source=bl&ots=UbjGftmtyx&sig=z0Pgn3G108GtNr1y1RGlq17Bj1g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fe2CUs_gGKyosATqoICADg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=beer%20with%20formaldehyde%20vietnam&f=false  http://1001plus.blogspot.com/2012/02/historical-inaccuracy.html http://www.empireonline.com/features/complete-american-history-in-movies/14.asp http://www.historynet.com/adrian-cronauer-air-force-radio-announcer-in-vietnam.htm http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-10-16/news/0210160283_1_adrian-cronauer-robin-williams-military-journalists http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AGood_Morning,_Vietnam http://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics.html This movie appeals to all audiences, as it has little romance, very few war scenes, and almost no historical consistencies.	217.35293987300247

Williams’ spirited portrayal of a zany disc jockey in Good Morning, Vietnam led to a Golden Globe Award for best actor, an Oscar nomination for best actor and box office success for Hollywood’s first Vietnam War comedy.  It also forged a special bond between Williams and the people who had worked at AFVN, a military-run radio and TV operation that broadcast news and entertainment to the troops.  I interviewed Williams on the movie set, outside Bangkok, in 1987 for Asia Magazine and “Business Update,” a radio program produced by American Public Radio (now Public Radio International).  It was clear that Williams had done his homework.	211.43720813401887

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures.  At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe.  Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion.  The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures.  It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.  It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time.  The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers.  Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back.  The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO.  During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives.  It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	276.2418045482482

It’s a nation that is hurtling towards the future at high speed, with impressive new engineering feats popping up each year.  The 500-year-old Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks of Asia and according to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei who orbited in 2003, it can’t be seen from the moon.  The structure is a collection of walls, towers, fortresses and barracks stretching 21,196km (13,171 miles).  The section of the Great Wall that receives the most visitors are Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing.  You can explore this famous landmark in Asia as a day trip from the capital.  2- Angkor Wat Angkkor Wat is a stunning Asian landmark to visit.	185.24588417494488

Malaysia is a multicultural melting pot of Malay, Indian and Chinese cultures, with incredibly tasty food and lush landscapes.  Although there its rich biodiversity has endowed it with plenty of natural attractions, the most famous landmark in this Asian country is a manmade marvel.  Standing above the skyline of the nation’s capital, the Petronas Twin Towers is the world’s tallest twin towers (451.8 m).  They took six years to build and were designed by César Pelli who created this masterpiece using Islamic concepts and geometric forms, including that of the eight-pointed star.  The observation decks on the 86th floor of both towers are connected by a bridge and have stunning views over Kuala Lumpur.  5- Marina Bay Sands Another Asian landmark to see is Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.

243	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_13_972701974-6	Walking the Great Wall Today Most people who choose to walk the Great Wall of China today choose to walk either a small portion of it, or pick specific, picturesque spots to do a series of connected hikes. This is because many parts of the wall are very run down, and it’s not possible to walk all the way along the top.  In the areas close to Beijing, and other tourist hotspots, the Chinese government has invested a significant amount in the upkeep of the wall, making it a very pleasant, if challenging, hike.  The most popular parts of the wall lie near to the capital, including Badaling and Mutianyu.  Here you are likely to find the wall crammed with tourists in peak season, making it difficult to walk.  However, these sections are particularly well-maintained, and set among glorious scenery, with views over the forest.  For a day trek, the section between Jinshanling and Simatai is very popular.  This section only attracts tour groups at Jinshanling, and once you set off, you’re likely to meet very few people along the way.  The wall is crumbling and broken down in places, but remains accessible, and this 11km hike takes you through some of the region’s finest scenery.	134.09769555111416
244	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_21_1394706798-5	The restoration and preservation initiatives are being taken up by the government and other non-governmental bodies like the International Friends of the Great Wall and The China Great Wall Society who clean the areas surrounding the most frequently visited areas of the wall and keep a close check on the structural maintenance. Through Western contact with China from the 17th through 20th centuries, the fame of the Great Wall grew and so did tourism.  It grew at a whopping rate after President Nixon visited the wall in 1972.  Today, a portion of the Great Wall of China, about 80 km from Beijing, is host to about 6 million tourists every year.  Many historians have a view that by building a wall of this length, the manpower that went into it, and the deaths reported or assumed during the construction, it would have caused lesser casualties even if another kingdom would have attacked and gotten into a war with China.  But from accounts of the Chinese, the wall stands as a representation of their unity and pride.  Like it?  Share it!  « Previous Post Next Post »	133.87947439332493
245	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander. Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places.  In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders.  In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea).  The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire.  Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier.  It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads.  Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world.  In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	125.17502256284934
246	139_2-7	Okay. So what’s another famous landmark in Asia besides the Great Wall of China?	MARCO_18_1914156314-21	In addition to rebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu's reign. The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations, and forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone frontages.  From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang.  Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east.  The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian.  Behind this line of fortifications, the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia, generally secure from attacks from the north.	155.51734069630038

248	139_2-7	Okay. So what’s another famous landmark in Asia besides the Great Wall of China?	MARCO_11_334610726-2	The most recent portion of the Great Wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644); this is also the portion of the wall that is best preserved. In the Ming Dynasty, General Qi Jiquang ordered for the Great Wall to be rebuilt to help fortify the Capital of Beijing.  The project to rebuild the wall around Beijing was complete in 1644.  China started to build border walls in the Zhou Dynasty in 770 BC.  It was under the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) who officially commissioned the Great Wall extension.  In 206 BC, the wall was lengthened to include parts of western China so that China could fortify itself and protect its silk road trade route.  The construction of the wall was extended to the Yumen Pass.  The Yumen Pass, also known as the Jade Gate or Pass of the Jade Gate, is located in Dunhuang in Gansu Province, China.  The Great Wall In The Snow Length of the Great Wall of China The entire length of the Great Wall is about 21,196 kilometers or 13,171 miles.  This includes overlapping sections of the Great Wall.

The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.   Section::::Construction.   The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra.  Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.  An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above riverbank.  In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.  Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.  The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.   The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took efforts from 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.	123.67915479582734

Awaiting your revert.  Happy holidays!  Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well!  My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such.  It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another.  So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities.  I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing.  The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights.  Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	210.46404975543555

Enjoy a brief account of each of the new Seven Wonders: Taj Mahal, Agra, India The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum of white marble built by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, in the loving memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; the Taj Mahal is one of the wonders of the world that continues to hold an attraction for all through the globe.  Twenty-thousand men labored on its construction, which began in 1631 and took 22 years to complete.  It is a symbol of eternal love and is worth a visit, especially on a full moon night.

256	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization. The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan.  The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari.  Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute.  Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well.  Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders.  This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details.  The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	178.61721300954014

It took more than 22,000 workers, 1,000 elephants and 22 years to build this incredible structure.  Now there are concerns that it will crumble into pieces as its wooden foundations are rotting away.  6.

Lists from other eras In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind, and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages.  However, it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages, because the word "" medieval "" was not invented until the Enlightenment -era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century.  Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as ""later list [  s]"", suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.  Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known.  Typically representative are: Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa located in Alexandria, Egypt.

260	139_2-15	What are the other natural wonders of the world besides the Great Barrier Reef?	MARCO_40_1229337887-2	However, there are now several different categories of the “Seven Wonders”, and knowing which ones are in each category can be most peoples first stumbling block. I recently wrote an article on the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World and the Seven Modern Wonders.  Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza.  All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time.  The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq.  The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters.  So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.  So the next time someone asks you to name the Seven Wonders of the World, your first question should be to ask which of the wonders.  Below we take a look at the Seven Natural Wonders of The World.	166.10293340336648

MARCO_49_1460908036-1	Influence of Nature in Architecture | Plan n Design Influence of Nature in Architecture nitikabanhani_76534 Updated on 2018-10-14 In Architecture Over the years architecture has been influenced by various factors apart from which era and when it has been established.  Various influences that we see are in the way a building has been constructed, i.e. the form of the building, the various structural elements of the building, etc. Nature has been one of the most evident influences in architecture and in various forms over the years.  Since time immemorial nature and the environment has inspired various aspects of our life.  The humbleness and the beauty of nature have been one of the most inspirational idea for the humans.  Small dwellings and the pattern of their arrangement have been inspired by nature.  Nature is an integral part of our lives.  Natural forms are not created by a single force or events; nor by the simple co-existence of many parts, it is the interaction of each part to its immediate surrounding that initiates processes.  Architecture is not far behind when it comes to being inspired by nature.  The examples of the same are quite prevalent all over the world, and over the centuries, from the pre-historic times to the present day, architecture and nature go hand-in-hand.	179.20386550750845
264	139_2-19	I like that philosophy. Form should follow function. Is the Taj Mahal an example of Organic Architecture?	MARCO_14_1277270212-6	Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called “the best all-time work of American architecture”.  Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.  His creative period spanned more than 70 years.  Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater, 1936-39: Fallingwater stands as one of Wright’s greatest masterpieces, both for its dynamism and for its integration with the striking natural surroundings.  It serves as a perfect example of his “organic” philosophy, whereby structures were designed in harmony with humanity and its environment.  Wright’s work includes original and innovative examples of many building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums.  Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass.  Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe.  His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio.	254.1104529992008

Design The complex exemplifies Wright's Prairie School ideal and is comparable with other notable works from this period in his career, such as the Robie House in Chicago and the Dana-Thomas House in Springfield, Illinois.  Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"".  Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century.  The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity.  — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"".  In 1900 Edward Bok of the Curtis Publishing Company, bent on improving American homes, invited architects to publish designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, the plans of which readers could purchase for five dollars."	215.06779742406437

Reproduced by permission of Archive Photos, Inc. and traditional ideas.  There was, first, the romantic idea of honest  expression: that a building should be faithful in revealing its  materials and structure, as Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc  (1814–1879) had argued, without any classical ornament or fake  surface or structure.  There was, second, the idea that a  building's form should reflect its plan, its functional  arrangement of interior spaces, as Henry Latrobe and Horatio Greenough  had proposed.  There was, third, the belief that each building should  express something new and distinctive in the times (G. W. F. Hegel    [  1770–1831], Gottfried Semper  [  1803–1879]) and  specifically the new technical resources, such as steel skeletons and electric light and elevators, which suggested  skyscrapers and new forms of building (John Wellborn Root).  There was,  fourth, the ambition, even pride, to achieve an art appropriate to a new  nation, an American art, without Continental or English or colonial  dependencies.	199.25720197822372

The former settlement's location was west of Arcola along the BNSF Railway near Houston Southwest Airport.  In 2014 the town site was no longer accessible by public roads.   Section::::History.   The town of Duke grew up on the Sugar Land Railroad as a shipping point for sugar cane.  Water from conveniently nearby Clear Lake was used to service the railroad locomotives.  Postal service began in 1883 with John R. Fenn as postmaster.  The bustling community consisted of a hotel, stock yard, store and sugar mills.  The town was named after Duke Hessey, who operated the store.  On October 19, 1888 there was a political rally at Duke that nearly resulted in violence between the contending factions.  During the tense political struggle which later erupted in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War there was an attempt at civil debate.  However, when Woodpecker candidate Kyle Terry took the stage at Duke, he had harsh words for his opponent Ned Gibson, a Jaybird.  Though Gibson was not there, one of his brothers took vigorous offense.  Terry brandished a pistol but was prevented from using it by an elderly African-American man, a former slave of the Terry family.	382.60165062601845

281	140_1-9	Duke town. I’m intrigued. Tell me more about Duke Town in Calabar.	KILT_28678189-3	Akwa Akpa, also known as Duke Town to the British, became a center of the slave trade, where slaves were exchanged for European goods.  The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area.   Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.  By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.  They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.   Section::::Later history.   The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.	277.99572121823167
282	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-4	"With the suppression of the slave trade, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports.  In 1846 a Christian mission was established by the United Presbyterian Church between Duke Town and Henshaw town, with the support of King Eyo.  The mission was headed by Rev. Hope Masterton Waddell with support from Hugh Goldie, who wrote an account of Calabar in his 1890 book ""Calabar and its Mission"".  That year the chiefs requested British protection for Calabar, but the reply from Lord Palmerston, received in 1848, was that it was not necessary or advisable to grant the request.  The British said they would treat the people of Calabar favorably if they would give up their practice of human sacrifice.  At the time, it was common for wives and slaves of an important man to be sacrificed upon his death.   On the death of King Eyamba in 1847, it was proposed that King Eyo become sole ruler, which the British favored.  However, the Duke Town leaders did not agree, and selected Archibong Duke as the new king.  In 1850, both kings agreed to suppress human sacrifice.   British influence continued to grow, as did acceptance of Christianity.  The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884."	286.4115207836646
283	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_1442062-1	Calabar  Calabar (also referred to as Callabar, Calabari, Calbari, Kalabari and Kalabar) is the capital of Cross River State, Nigeria.  It was originally named Akwa Akpa, in Efik language.  The city is adjacent to the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers and creeks of the Cross River (from its inland delta).   Calabar is often described as the tourism capital of Nigeria.  Administratively, the city is divided into Calabar Municipal and Calabar South Local Government Areas.  It has an area of and a population of 371,022 as at 2006 census.   Section::::History.   On 10 September, 1884, Queen Victoria signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar.  This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi.   Today, Calabar is a large metropolis with several towns like Akim, Ikot Ansa, Ikot Ishie, Kasuk, Duke Town, Henshaw Town, Cobham Town, Ikot Omin, Obutong.   Section::::History.:Seaport City.   Since the 16th century, Calabar had been a recognized international seaport, shipping out goods such as palm oil.  During the era of the Atlantic slave trade, it became a major port in the transportation of African slaves and was named Calabar by the Spanish.	270.98459831291257
284	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_39388584-1	Eyo Honesty II  King Eyo Honesty II was the ruler of Creek Town from approximately 1835 to 1858 when he died.  Creek Town was part of the Old Calabar region in the Bight of Biafra.  Old Calabar was a series of towns up the Cross River, which is in the Southeast edge of present-day Nigeria.  Honesty is an example of African agency in the Atlantic Slave Trade because he was a strong, savvy, and intelligent leader who worked with the Europeans instead of against them, which brought about changes that would forever affect the region.   Section::::Early life.   Although his exact date of birth is unknown, Eyo was cited to have been born in 1788 by an epitaph located on a tower of the Creek Town Presbyterian Church.  As a child, Eyo served as a cabin boy to English traders in the Triangle Trade network.  It was during this time that he learned to speak and write the English language.  He also learned the ways of the slave trade and how to do business which would benefit him as a ruler later on in life.  After his father lost the throne, his family fell upon hard times and Eyo found himself in the employment of his father's rival, the Great Duke Ephraim, after his father died in 1820.	257.4164986426744

The yams can be mashed or fried in oil.  Meat is another delicacy that is prepared into something known as suya (a form of meat resembling barbecue meat) and wild meat (from giraffes and antelopes).  Most of the foods are spicy, especially in the west and the south.  Other forms of traditional food include fufu, eba, okra, egusi, and ogbono.  Drinks include traditional brews like palm wine.

The nutritional value and health benefits of fufu are: 1.  It is also very rich in carbohydrates and can supply the body a lot of energy.  2.  It is very low in cholesterol.  3.  It contains a lot of potassium.  Health Risks Just two wraps of fufu contain more than 600 calories.  That can make you very fat.  Fufu has a glycemic index of 84.

289	140_4-4	Is eating fufu without chewing safe?	KILT_844568-1	Fufu  Fufu (or foofoo, fufuo, foufou) is a staple food common in many countries in West Africa such as Cote D'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Liberia, Togo and Nigeria.  It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian method by mixing and pounding separate equal portions of cassava and green plantain flour thoroughly with water.  It is then adjusted to either increase or decrease the viscosity of the fufu depending on personal preferences.  Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour.  Fufu is often served with groundnut soup, palm nut soup, abunuabunu or light soup.   The traditional method is to boil starchy food crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough-like consistency.  Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce.    Section::::African fufu.   Portuguese traders introduced the cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century.  In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky (if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding).  The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one's right hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball.	237.44140240916204
290	140_4-4	Is eating fufu without chewing safe?	MARCO_19_654638400-9	In Western and Central Africa, the more common method is to serve a mound of fufu along with a soup ( ọbẹ ). After washing hands, the diner pinches off a small ball of fufu and makes an indentation with the thumb.  This reservoir is then filled with soup, and the ball is eaten.  In Nigeria and Ghana, the ball is often not chewed but swallowed whole—in fact, chewing fufu is considered a faux pas.  Therefore, fufu not only serves as a food but also as a utensil.  One of the low points of fufu was the smell which lingers on long after the meal, however new and improved species of cassava and improved cassava processing has eliminated the smell of fufu making it more accepted as a meal.  A selection of soups that could be served with fufu includes but not limited to: light (tomato) soup, palm nut soup, groundnut soup, peppersoup, and other types of soups with vegetables such as okra, nkontomire (cocoyam leaves).  Soups are often made with different kinds of meat and fish, fresh or smoked.  Groundnut stew Maafe, prepared by a Senegalese cook.  Groundnut stew ( maafe ), (var.	224.5352659574573

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).  The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries.

Nigerian Jollof Rice The first key difference in Nigerian Jollof is the type of rice grain used.  Nigerian Jollof is made with long grain parboiled rice.  Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria, but imported from Asian countries.  A second difference is the method of cooking.  The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content.  Party Jollof rice, is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations.  This dish is legendary for its smoky taste.  This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour.  A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavour.  Ghanian Jollof Rice Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice.  Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice.  Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell.  Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India.  The basmati rice is not parboiled.  Parboiling makes it soggy.	281.93118231920687

KILT_4030485-5	Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base.  Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid.  The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc.  In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice and there are variations of the classic jollof rice; including coconut jollof rice, fisherman jollof rice (made with prawns, periwinkles, crayfish), mixed vegetables jollof rice, and rice and beans.  More economical versions of jollof rice are popularly referred to among Nigerians as “concoction rice,” the preparation of which can involve as little as rice and pepper.

Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the ""Athens of Jalisco"", owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there.  Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador.  The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers.  By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region.  Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno.  Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated Convenios de Lagos.  The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s.

Temperatures are generally high and consistent, and seasons are more aptly characterised by the difference in rainfall than a change in the mercury.  For example, in Lagos, average temperatures barely range from 77°F (25°C) to 82°F (28°C).  June is the season with peak rains, while January hardly sees any by comparison.  In the south of the country, a coastal region that includes Lagos and the oil-rich area of Port Harcourt, it’s incredibly humid, but it rarely gets hotter than 90°F (32°C).

327	141_2-1	So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?	MARCO_02_420075955-1	Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital.  Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s.  A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time.  The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return.  This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return.  Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme.  How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example.  Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month.  The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month.  The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest.  This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.	250.1845008764285

The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

329	141_2-1	So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?	KILT_34997299-1	"Business Consulting International  Business Consulting International was a London-based investment company that collapsed after being exposed by a City of London Police investigation in 2008 as the United Kingdom's biggest ponzi scheme, estimated at £115M. The business was set up and run by Kautilya Nandan Pruthi, a London-based Indian businessman, in partnership with Kenneth Peacock and John Anderson, who both lived in Sunningdale, Surrey.   Based from rented offices at 1 Relton Mews, Knightsbridge, the proposal of BCI was that clients lent it money, so that BCI in turn could lend that money at very high rates of interest to ""distressed"" businesses that found themselves unable to borrow from banks for short periods of time.   Pruthi through BCI offered investors a return of between 4% and 20% a month on short-term fixed deposits of between four weeks and a year, while Anderson and Peacock through their own consulting companies promised slightly lower rates, passing on their deposits directly to Pruthi."	212.99812319765624

Louis J. Perlman Lou Perlman, the manager of such singing sensations as the “Backstreet Boys.”  and ‘NSync, conducted a $500 million dollar Ponzi scheme.  In 2006, it was discovered that Pearlman was the head of one of the largest and longest running Ponzi schemes in American history, leaving almost half a billion dollars in debts.  Perlman headed up Transcontinental Airlines Travel Services Inc. and Transcontinental Airlines Inc., and the Transcontinental Savings Program (collectively referred to as “Transcontinental”), which existed only on paper.	213.67621469814912

MARCO_55_1041747783-13	Because it can only grow so far, any Ponzi scheme is destined to eventually collapse under its own weight, so the con man usually pulls a disappearing act after collecting enough money, leaving the investors with nothing but the fake returns they received to keep them involved in the swindle. Undoubtedly the most famous recent example involved Bernard Madoff, a New York financier who engineered a Ponzi scheme estimated to be in the neighborhood of $65 billion.  Madoff was eventually caught and sentenced to 150 years in prison, but not before pulling of what is essentially the biggest con game of all time.  Other Articles you Might Like Liked it?

MARCO_02_420075955-2	After ten months the fraudster will have returned all the money invested by the very first investors (assuming they did not reinvest), but will have most of the money invested by later investors. At this point the fraudster simply takes the money and disappears.  Spotting Ponzi schemes Common types of Ponzi scheme operate under a variety of names including “high yield investment program” and “high yield debentures”.  Their common characteristics are very high returns with no clear underlying business to generate them.  More complex forms of Ponzi scheme can be harder to detect.  They may well appear to be legitimate investments.  They may even be part of an investment that includes both legitimate and Ponzi elements.  An example of the latter is an investment or finance company that offers very high returns to depositors, and does lend the money (as a real finance company would) to make returns, but does so knowing that the return on loans will not suffice to cover the interest paid to depositors.  Returns that are too consistent are also a reason for suspicion.  This was a characteristic of the fraudulent fund run by Bernard Madoff.	137.785519121142
333	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_18_1642035430-6	"Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme Theoretically it is not impossible at least for certain entities operating as Ponzi scheme to ultimately ""succeed"" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment.  Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ).  Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.  Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	170.88886812198325

MARCO_18_1642035430-7	"Promoters who intend to abscond often attempt to do so as returns due to be paid are about to exceed new investments, as this is when the investment capital available will be at its maximum. Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).  Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.  The wide gap between ""money in"" and ""fictitious gains"" make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme."	167.5276487346855

All other cyber currencies are Ponzi schemes, too, except, arguably, initial coin offerings (ICOs) funding actual business start-ups.  Ponzi schemes promise investors returns above what real investments yield, but the Ponzi scheme operator does little, if any, actual investing.  Instead, cash from new investors is paid to earlier investors to maintain the illusion that the scheme is earning real profits.  All Ponzi schemes eventually collapse, of course, when sufficient amounts can no longer be raised from new investors to pay off earlier investors.  The same will occur with bitcoin and all other cyber currencies, except perhaps the ICOs.  Investors will pull back from buying cyber currencies, causing their prices to begin a sustained decline.	146.66118857119
339	141_2-9	I know that there are similar schemes to Ponzi schemes. Can you compare them?	MARCO_36_840746247-2	A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud whereby crooks steal money from investors and mask the theft by funneling returns to clients from funds contributed by newer investors. Bernard Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a $65 billion scam encompassing thousands of investors that was uncovered in 2008.  Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release.  Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds.  In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.  While it’s too soon to tell if last year’s total was an anomaly, some experts fear it could herald a return to more sinister times.	205.0075960564427

MARCO_02_407019929-7	Advertisement Ponzi Schemes vs. Pyramid Schemes ­ ­Many people associate Ponzi schemes with pyramid schemes. While they do share some similarities, they're not exactly the same.  If you think about the organization and methodology behind a Ponzi scheme, it certainly has a triangular structure.  The schemer sits at the top, above continually increasing rungs of investors.  However, there are fundamental differences between how classic pyramid schemes are carried out and how Ponzi schemes are executed.  Advertisement The essential difference between a pyramid scheme and a Ponzi scheme is that a Ponzi schemer will only ask you to invest in something.  You won't be asked to take any more action than handing over money.  He or she will claim to take care of the rest and give you your returns later.  The Ponzi schemer is the mastermind behind the whole system and is always shuffling money from one place to another.  On the other hand, a pyramid schemer will offer you an opportunity to make the money yourself.  It requires more work, though: You have to buy the right to start a franchise and start recruiting more people like yourself.  The recruits will often pay the recruiter a cut of their profits.  You can read How Pyramid Schemes Work to understand more about that process.	125.52410025306745

As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:  BULLET::::- In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value.  A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.   BULLET::::- Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant.  Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).  Even when this occurs, wrongdoing (and especially criminal activity) is often much more difficult to prove in court compared to a Ponzi scheme."	147.69843241362832
343	141_2-11	What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?	MARCO_44_647739316-2	"Bernie Madoff has become synonymous with the Ponzi scheme, in which the payment of returns to current investors come from money deposited by new investors; meanwhile, the advisor siphons off some of the money. The affinity fraud targets a group, often in combination with a Ponzi scheme, such as a religious organization or friend group, by convincing the group to go along with a scam because their friends are involved.  Other scams include misrepresenting qualifications, such as claiming experience or certifications you don't have or promising unrealistic returns, such as claiming an investment will generate huge numbers.  With a ""churning"" scam, the advisor makes lots of unnecessary trades, which costs the customer in commissions and often results in less-than-stellar investment returns.  Ponzi Scheme According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk.”  The Ponzi scheme is a classic scam and incorporates components of other scams as well.  The investment proceeds in this classic scam are simply the new investors' monies doled out to existing clients."	124.20327817439102
344	141_2-11	What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?	KILT_47185-1	"Ponzi scheme  A Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.  The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.   The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.   The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"".  Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate, and then stole the money that the women had invested.  She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens' 1844 novel ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" and his 1857 novel ""Little Dorrit"" both feature such a scheme."	118.51222984935156
345	141_2-13	Economic bubbles sound like cryptocurrency	MARCO_15_1835637011-2	This occurs so rapidly that the pressure inside the bubble becomes higher than that of the water, so it expands to equalize, again overshooting. The bubble oscillates between high and low pressure at a high frequency, creating a distinctive and well-quantified sound.  The sound radiates energy, so the bubble eventually reaches equilibrium with its surroundings.     The frequency of the sound is well defined (Minnaert 1993) and depends on bubble radius, local pressure, local water density, and a geophysical constant.  The important observation is that the size of the bubble is inversely proportional to its resonance (ringing) frequency.  Larger bubbles ring at lower frequencies and smaller bubbles ring at higher frequencies.  The sound radiated is often loud and narrowly tuned in frequency (a pure tone).  But quickly, after just tens of milliseconds, a bubble in water becomes a quiet adult bubble and changes its role—it absorbs sound and is especially efficient at absorbing sound at its resonance frequency.  Naturally occurring raindrops range in size from about 300 microns in diameter (a drizzle droplet) to more than 5 millimeters in diameter (often at the beginning of a heavy downpour).  As the drop size changes, the shape of the splash changes and so does the subsequent sound production.  In laboratory and field studies (Medwin et al.	294.9508516205205

A bursting sound, which is produced by wrap while pressing a bubble, is stress relieving.  It is difficult to keep off a pouch with bubbles, if it is lying somewhere on your way.  Apps developers recognized this effect, and it resulted in a number of electronic games, such as Mugen Puchipuchi and alike, imitating a sound of a popping bubble by mouse click.  There is a Bubble Wrap Appreciation Day in the last Monday of December.  This special day appeared after some radio station in Indiana received a delivery with microphones wrapped with this packing.  After the equipment was unpacked and installed, the sound of bursting air bubbles was broadcast in the open air of the radio station.

This is the most common way to spot a casting call scam.  They insist the candidate to join immediately without audition.

A second person will tell you it's a scam, but that you can scam the scammer by not clicking the grand seed pod and just picking up your stuff and leaving with the scammer's money (this is the real part of the scam).  However, the scammer will decline the trade and use group chat to teleport you away after you drop items.  (The grand seed pod is actually used as a distraction)  To avoid the scam, simply do not drop an item when requested and do not risk wealth when following a player proposing impossible things.  Also, do not join group chat with people promising such things.

This is important because - let's face it - if you don't find him interesting now, you won't find him any more interesting on a date.  {""smallUrl"":""https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/5\/5a\/Start-a-Conversation-with-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg\/v4-460px-Start-a-Conversation-with-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\/images\/thumb\/5\/5a\/Start-a-Conversation-with-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg\/aid501595-v4-728px-Start-a-Conversation-with-a-Guy-Step-9.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":345,""bigWidth"":728,""bigHeight"":546,""licensing"":""<div class=\""mw-parser-output\""><p>License: <a target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""nofollow noreferrer noopener\"" class=\""external text\"" href=\""https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\"">Creative Commons<\/a><br>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><\/div>""} 4 Pose an interesting question."	109.15294591337442
354	142_1-1	What should I know about Argentina?	MARCO_39_1449992234-5	Key facts every expat should know about Argentina The majority of rental properties will require that you pay your monthly rent in USD, often in cash. Expats who wish to enter into a long-term rental agreement will need a “garantia”; someone who lives and owns a business in Argentina who is prepared to guarantee that all rent payments will be made.  If you cannot find a guarantor, you may be required to make all rental payments in advance.  This can be risky and expensive.  Always ensure that you have access to cash and small change.  The majority of places will only accept cash payment, and there is a distinct lack of small change throughout Argentina; if you do not have coins in your possession, you may not be able to board the bus or pay for a taxi.  If you are a foreigner, you are expected to pay cash in full for purchasing real estate.  Expatriates who generate an income abroad are not required to pay tax when they transfer the funds into Argentina.  Many employers will tell you that you do not need a work visa to work for them.  This is untrue.  Legally employers are required to register you as an employee but fail to do so because it incurs additional costs for the company in tax and social security.	270.4694814448885

However if you're planning to travel to Argentina you need to know that this beautiful country is so much more than that!  So we thought we'd dig up 10 interesting facts you didn’t know about Argentina, curious bits of information that don't usually get a mention in your average Argentina travel guide: 1.  Invented Radio Broadcasting Argentina was one of the first countries in the world to have radio broadcasting.  The country’s first broadcast was made in August 1920.  At that time only 20 people had a receiver!  One of the first radio ads.  2  .  Two female presidents The Ex President, and actual Argentinian vice President, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, was the first woman President to be officially elected in Argentina.  However she isn’t the first female president to ever rule over Argentina.  Isabél Perón - who was the vice president to her husband Juan Domingo Perón – stood in as Argentina’s first female president for two years, after her husband’s sudden death in 1974.

Enjoy Argentina breakfast in Buenos Aries The best place to find a real Argentinian breakfast is in Buenos Aries’ cafés.  Once frequented by bohemian writers like Jorges Luis Borges, these cozy eateries are perfect for an authentic Argentina breakfast.  For example, Borges used to enjoy coffee at La Biela in Recoleta.  Another historic option is El Federal in San Telmo, which is nearly 150 years old.  For more varied options – or for those craving a more substantial brunch – another good spot is Oui Oui.  However, this French-inspired café is extremely popular, so go with a view to taking a stroll around Palermo after you put your name on the list.

Rosario is the perfect place to do that.  A million miles away from the most popular destinations such as Buenos Aires or Bariloche, set on the Parana River banks, this is a place where you can really get to experience the real Argentine way of life – slower, peaceful.

Travel to the north and you’ll see Argentinian dishes that originate from the indigenous populations there.  There is so much delicious popular food in Argentina to try besides just steak!  I hope you brought your appetite, let’s get started.  Pizza & Faina While Argentina was settled largely by Italian immigrants, the pizza tastes nothing like a thin Neapolitan pie.  If you want to try proper Porteño pizza, skip the takeout and head to Avenida Corrientes.  The street comes to life at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square, lined with theaters and neon lights.  The crust is thick, light on the sauce and HEAVY on the cheese.  Sit and order a whole pie or order a slice to eat standing at the bar.  The best wine pairing is poured from a box by a grumpy old man.  If you really want to sound like a local, order a slice of fainâ to go with it.  Faina is a chickpea pancake or pie, placed on top of the pizza, it’s a little too starch on starch for my taste but it’s not bad!  Where to try pizza in Buenos Aires The best by the slice pizzerias are on Avenida Corrientes downtown.	119.34062790099097

However, they’re not usually stuffed with meat.  Instead, these Argentine foods are filled with cheese or vegetables. 16.  Carbonada: Your Winter Stew Carbonada is a popular stew during Argentina’s winter months.  Carbonada combines meat, potatoes, corn on the cob, carrots, peppers, and bacon.  It’s topped with fruits like peaches, raisins, and pears.  Once the mixture is prepared, carbonada is poured into a hollowed-out pumpkin.  It’s then barbecued.  Sometimes, the stew is used for empanadas.  Its warm flavor and heartiness make carbonada a delicious Argentine food during the cold season.  17.

Typical foods Dulce de leche, a popular national spread used to fill cakes and pancakes, eaten over toast, and as an ice-cream flavour Boxed empanadas Most regions of Argentina are known for their beef-oriented diet.  Grilled meat from the asado (barbecue) is a staple, with steak and beef ribs especially common.  The term asado itself refers to long strips of flank-cut beef ribs.  Popular items such as chorizo (pork sausage ), morcilla ( blood sausage ), chinchulines ( chitterlings ), mollejas ( sweetbread ), and other parts of the animal are also enjoyed.  In Patagonia, however, lamb and chivito (goat) are eaten more frequently than beef.  Whole lambs and goats are traditionally cooked over an open fire in a technique known as asado a la estaca.  The most common condiment for Asado is chimichurri, a sauce of herbs, garlic and vinegar.	102.6218344283334

368	142_1-3	What makes Buenos Aires the culture capital of South America?	KILT_255919-1	"Buenos Aires  Buenos Aires ( or ; ) is the capital and largest city of Argentina.  The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast.  ""Buenos Aires"" can be translated as ""fair winds"" or ""good airs"", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name ""Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre"".  The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6 million.   The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district.  In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.  The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city.  The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (""Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires""; ""CABA"")."	196.21675387943745

There are many cinemas and galleries in major urban centers which are popular with richer, elite members of society and visiting them is regarded as something of a status symbol.  However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	163.21334917319473

With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.

Modern Argentinian culture has been strongly influenced by its European immigrant population but with a South American flair.

KILT_67340-46	The unique condition of Argentina, as a country which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina.   According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier.  Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.   Duncan and Fogarty (1984) argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina.  According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia's, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.	149.6813864637952

In April 1671 he was commissioned to organise a party for the Duc de Condé, owner of Chantilly, and his cousin Louis XIV at the Chateau.  The party lasted from 23 to 25 April, sumptuous meals were served, illuminations, hunting and lavish entertainment were organised.  For the famed Vatel however, things did not go so well.  There were problems in the kitchen and with supplies and it is said that unable to bear the indignity of failure, Vatel committed suicide before the party was over.  Legend has it that one of the problems was the non delivery of cream for the dishes Vatel had planned.  In order to give volume to the cream supplies he had, Vatel created Chantilly cream.

Mainly for its beautiful landscapes and then for its cultural heritage, Argentina receives massive numbers of travelers.  The Argentine territory stretches from the highest peaks of the Andes in the west to colitis del Norte rivers and extensive beaches and cliffs of Argentine Sea in the east; from the tropical rainforest of the Yungas north to the valleys, glaciers, lakes and cold forests of Andean Patagonia in the south, and to Argentine Antarctica.	225.57259629625744

MARCO_38_1732109210-4	Argentina is a long way from the turmoil of 2001 but today’s mix of rising prices, wage pressures and the mistrust of the peso have nasty echoes of the past. Internationally, too, Argentina has lost its way.  It has shut itself out of global capital markets, although negotiations are under way to restructure its debts with the Paris Club of international creditors.  Brazil, hardly a free-trade paragon, is pressing Argentina to open its borders; once it would have been the other way round.  “Only people this sophisticated could create a mess this big,” runs a Brazilian joke that plays on Argentines’ enduring sense of being special.  One hundred years of ineptitude The country’s dramatic decline has long puzzled economists.  Simon Kuznets, a Nobel laureate, is supposed to have remarked: “There are four kinds of countries in the world: developed countries, undeveloped countries, Japan and Argentina.”  Other countries have since managed to copy Japan’s rapid industrialisation; Argentina remains in a class of its own.  There is no shortage of candidates for the moment when the country started to go wrong.	199.2703645400543
381	142_5-9	That’s sad to hear. Is there more on how the shift away from pampas-raised beef has had on its quality?	WAPO_XWC7DVRLCUI6TMAR3BIAMRG4TA-3	Here’s Argentina’s secret: Every additional 100 meters (about 328 feet) of altitude decreases the average temperature by 1 degree Celsius. That means grapes with higher acidity and softer tannins.  But the intensity of the sunlight increases as well, allowing the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness while the cooler temperatures keep the sugars in check.  The combination of low temperatures and high-intensity sun yields red wines of high intensity and extraction, soft and almost imperceptible tannins, and impressive structure and balance.  Altitude is only one factor in Argentina’s reach for quality.  “Our wines are wines of the sun, but also of the soil,” says Sebastian Zuccardi, third-generation winemaker at Familia Zuccardi in Mendoza.  He is also in charge of winemaking at his family’s Santa Julia winery.  It would be easy to say the Zuccardi wines emphasize quality, while the Santa Julia label offers value, but that would be oversimplifying it.  Both lines offer value and quality.  The Zuccardi family built a new winery a few years ago in the Paraje Altamira area of the Uco Valley, about a 90-minute drive south of Mendoza.  Zuccardi uses concrete tanks for fermenting and aging his red wines, believing that way he can produce malbec that is most expressive of its terroir.	241.54430956722356

MARCO_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners. In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real.  This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers.  Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell.  All this led to a sharp reduction in exports.  As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998.  Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy.  In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket.  Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime.  As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	240.56175990998827

KILT_20311611-4	Although a number of grape varieties can be found growing in Argentina, the country’s most successful varietal is Malbec, a grape which has become largely synonymous with Argentine wine. Other grape varieties which perhaps hold the most promise for Argentina's future are Bonarda and Torrontés.   Section::::History.   Argentina's wine route is still relatively new.  Although the country’s wine production dates back to the 16th century, the inclination of growth for consumption was essentially based on volume and not quality, so there was little significance placed on the art of planting vine varieties best suited to each location and its ecosystem.  Argentina’s wine industry was transformed in the 1990s when international investors had the foresight to recognize the value and untapped resource of Argentina's wine producing potential.  It has been estimated that over $1.5 billion in new vineyard investment occurred in the following decade, designed to strengthen and improve the industry's production quality.  Argentina wine regions have since undergone a radical transformation, and now rival the production quality of European wine-producing countries.    The concept of creating tourism oriented enterprises has taken form over the past decade.  Renowned architects are translating brand identity into built structures, and now numerous iconic wineries dot the landscape of Argentina’s wine regions.	206.36866771579665

MARCO_54_1821438646-9	The truth is, they each have different things to offer, and if you’re going to make the effort to go the falls in the first place, you really should see both sides. Allow yourself two full days just for exploring both sides of the falls.  If you want to visit any other attractions in the area, such as the Itaipú Dam or Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, factor in an additional day for that.  How to Get to Iguazu Falls You have three options for visiting the falls: (1) tour Iguazu falls on your own by public transport; (2) go on an all-inclusive tour of Iguazu falls; or (3) take private transportation, but without a tour guide.  In my view, Iguazu tours are completely unnecessary and take all the fun out of exploring the falls on your own.  Large tour groups also clog up the pathways and can ruin the experience for other visitors, so I do not recommend this option.  If you’re staying in Foz do Iguaçu, it’s easy to reach the Brazilian side of the falls by taking the No. 120 public bus, which runs between the city, the airport and the falls.  Tickets cost less than four reais.	159.87747322418727

Walkways Inside the Falls The Catwalk of Iguassu Falls The best way to explore Iguassu Falls is to stay at least one night at the Belmond Hotel das Cataratas inside the park.  It is on the expensive side, but it is the only hotel in the National Park and by staying here, you have access to the trails along the falls and the catwalk leading into the horseshoe at sunrise and sunset.  12.  Iguazu Falls From Restaurant Footpath Things to do in Iguassu Falls There is an excellent viewing point at the main restaurant where you can see them from above, plus take an elevator or footpath down to the catwalk to see them up close.  Iguassu National Park opens at 8:00 am and closes at 5pm, so if you are not staying at the hotel, you have no chance of witnessing sunrise or sunset over the falls.  We were out at the crack of dawn and until after dusk exploring Iguassu Falls virtually on our own.  We only saw one or two other people at the falls so we were free to photograph and explore in solitude.  It was an incredible experience.	123.75959038850851

Dinner in Spain is lighter than la comida but can also consist of multiple courses.  Traditionally, la cena takes places around 10:00pm.  With schedules evolving, some people have begun to have a merienda-cena, which just means they have a final meal at an earlier time rather than an evening snack and then dinner.  Still, if you go out to eat around 8:30pm, when restaurants open for dinner, even popular places will be practically empty.

Similarly, a form of mate is sold in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in tea bags to be drunk in a similar way to tea.  This is known in Spanish as mate cocido or cocido.  In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of merienda (roughly, afternoon tea), often with a selection of facturas (sweet pastries).  It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools.  Cultivation Yerba mate The plant is grown mainly in South America, more specifically in Northern Argentina ( Corrientes, Misiones ), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil ( Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná ).  The Guaraní are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant; the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries, who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador.  When the yerba is harvested, the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor.  Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up.	164.0772796936899

El mate es una bebida deliciosa y nutritiva que proviene de las hojas de Ilex Paraguariensis, árbol que sólo crece en la región subtropical de América del Sur. ¿De dónde viene el mate?  El mate es una bebida de Sudamérica a base de hojas de yerba mate, sumamente popular en Argentina, Brasil, Uruguay y Paraguay.  Para entender su importancia actual, es necesario conocer su historia.  La yerba de los guaraníes El consumo de mate se remonta al pueblo guaraní (indígenas nativos de algunos países de Sudamérica), según confirmaron las investigaciones del ensayista Amaro Villanueva.  Los guaraníes masticaban directamente las hojas o las colocaban en una calabaza con agua y sorbían.  De hecho, la palabra “mate” viene del guaraní “Caa-mate” (“Caa” sería planta o hierba, y “mate” se refiere a la calabaza, el recipiente donde la bebían).  Otros pueblos como los incas, los charrúas y aún los araucanos adoptaron la costumbre del mate gracias a trueques con los guaraníes.  Para los indígenas, el árbol de mate era un regalo sagrado de los dioses, y de hecho el mate tenía para ellos un significado especial y espiritual, además de sus propiedades y valor nutritivo.	150.5076741874218

This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

Buenos Aires, the capital, acquired such a dominance  that it led many observers to refer to it and its culture as if it were  the whole country.  The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity.  The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy.  The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires.  A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin.  Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration.  Population and wealth are unequally  distributed.  As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	167.39421511720866

You’ll get great summer weather in January, and you’ve got so many great choices once you get there.  Buenos Aires is a wonderful city that feels far more like Europe than it does Latin America.	249.91440791089556

It’s not only a spectacular country to explore, it’s super gay friendly.  To give you an idea, in 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalise gay marriage, making it the 10th in the world to do so, and the 2nd in the Americas (after Canada).  It also has progressive laws for adoption, and when the gender identity laws were introduced in 2012, Argentina became the world's most transgender-friendly country.  In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalise gay marriage!  In the media, Argentina has long been a trailblazer in the latino world, featuring a transgender actress Florencia De La Vega actually playing an openly transgender character as far back as 2004 in the telenovela Los Roldán.  Then in 2005 the television dating show 12 Corazones-Especial became the first in the country to exclusively feature gay men who kissed on camera – uncensored!	248.37895286553976

I also met several Chileans, Peruvians, Spaniards, Colombians and more in Argentina who struggled to assimilate.  Again, I’m not arguing with your point, I just don’t understand what this has to do with this particular article.  I have NO idea where you got the idea that I think any version of any language is “right.”  I even mentioned in my article that I speak with an Argentine accent but I often alter it to better accomodate the Mexicans and Puerto Ricans I deal with on a daily basis.  It doesn’t mean my Spanish is wrong and theirs is right, or the other way around.  I simply do it to make communication easier and make them more comfortable.  I think you read the title and just decided to be angry about it and leave a heated comment without fully considering what this article is actually about.  You were so ready to attack me that you didn’t even consider that fact that I CHOSE to leave the US to live in Argentina and I stayed there for nearly two years.	215.0223393803753
405	142_3-3	Tell me more about the tango.	MARCO_28_1829509253-7	To help you get the hang of it, let's try translating a few sentences from Spanish into English. ' En Argentina, se baila el tango. '  Literally, this is saying, 'In Argentina, the tango dances itself.'  In English, you could say, 'In Argentina, the tango is danced,' but you'd be most likely to say, 'In Argentina, they dance the tango.' 'Se construyeron las casas. '  Again, literally, 'The houses built themselves,' but it sounds much better to say either, 'The houses were built,' or, 'They built the houses.' 'Se puede ver el mar desde aquí. ' 'The ocean can be seen from here,' or, 'You can see the ocean from here.'  OK, now let's take some impersonal and passive sentences in English and see how you would translate them into Spanish using the impersonal se. '  The dishes were washed.'  To say this in Spanish, we would start with se, then add the correct form of the verb lavar.  What was washed?  The dishes, so the verb will need to be in the third person plural form.	198.8775504606456

MARCO_13_429898392-1	The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance Tango is one of the most famous and influential dances in the world.  Originating in Buenos Aires in the 18th century, tango brought together working class European immigrants, indigenous Argentinians and former slaves.  As a result, tango has shaped Argentinian culture and society.  The dance’s popularity meant that it quickly expanded out of Argentina, with several different styles developing in Europe and North America.  With its rich history, tango is a fascinating tradition in dance which reveals a wealth of information about Argentina traditions.  Argentina traditions: The origin of tango The word “tango” or “tambo” appears around the turn of the 19th century to describe music and dance events organized by slaves.  The first official use of the word appears in a statute from 1789, where Argentine authorities banned “tango” gatherings to oppress the working class.  It wasn’t until one hundred years later that the word became commonplace.  The original tango dance was a blend of styles produced by the mix of cultures in the lively port of Buenos Aires.  In the 19th century, thousands of young people arrived from Europe in search of a better life.	176.64637970518288

Gaucho is the name given to the cowboys of South American countries, which include Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.  Some people in the city areas also wear this costume, but it would be a mistake to assume that all people in Argentina always wear these types of clothes – they do not.  As with most countries, there is an eclectic mix of clothing that people wear on a day to day basis, with people following latest fashions and trends, those who wear classic clothes, and those who prefer to wear traditional outfits, or elements of traditional costumes with more modern touches.  Typical footwear in Argentina includes the alpargatas.  This is a shoe made from canvas with a rope sole.  Sometimes, the sole may be rubber.  This style of shoe comes in a wide variety of different colours and patterns.  They are very sturdy and strong and last well.  These features made these shoes very popular in particular with people who worked outdoors and needed durable footwear.  Men often wear trousers called tje bombachas de campo, although they are unisex and so may also be worn by women.	223.11652638049785

Tourists wishing to fit in with peers in Argentina should avoid wearing baggy jeans and tennis shoes every day.  Fall in Argentina warrants a light jacket or sweater for evenings.  In winter, a warm jacket is important as many Argentineans use heating systems sparingly.  The spring brings plenty of rain and most people carry an umbrella or a raincoat.  The traditional clothing of Argentina includes gaucho costumes, canvas shoes and woolen ponchos.  The gaucho costume is similar to cowboy argentina clothing.

They are almost like the North American “cowboy” who have the genuine profession of herding the cattle and practice hunting to meet their economic needs.  Gauchos are nowadays considered as the symbol of the national pride of Argentina.  They are tremendous horse riders and famous for their distinctive and conventional costumes.The Gauchos of Argentina love to eat beef along with the herbal infusion prepared from Yerba and feel delighted to roam with their horses in the massive grasslands of the country.  The fascinating features of the Gauchos of Argentina are their traditional clothing items that mainly include “espadrilles” originally made with black canvas but are now produced with a wide range of colours and patterns; some are made with a rubber sole.  The bombachas are actually trousers made with strong cotton fabric traditionally in beige, white and black colors.  These trousers can be easily be identified because of the button they have at the ankle which is used to narrow them.

Open banking is a concept in financial services based on several principles: the use of open APIs allowing third party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions, increased financial transparency options for account holders and the use of open source technology to achieve these principles.  Using APIs means that banking data will be available in real-time, providing consumers with better ways to conduct transactions, save and invest their money.  Consumers may also have access to better loan terms since lenders will be able to look at historical transactional data to determine a borrower’s risk level.  Open Banking also aims to give consumers better and more personalized information for making sound financial decisions.  Around the world there are pressures, both regulatory and customer-led, that are opening up the financial services market to new entrants and disrupting what and how customers buy.  In Europe, the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is set to unleash a transformation in how financial services organizations view themselves and each other.  In the United States, aggregators such as Mint.com have already dis-intermediated banks and now own the ‘last mile’ of the customer banking relationship, disrupting traditional players.	203.75734778365583
414	143_1-3	Awesome, good to know. How does Open Banking regulation relate to PSD2?	MARCO_46_745032964-13	The Open Banking movement, heralded by Europe’s second Payments Service Directive and the United Kingdom’s Open Banking Standards, has the potential to accelerate the unbundling of banking in the regions where it applies, leading to increasingly intense competition over the next few years. The requirement for banks to share data and provide access to consumer and small-business accounts through a common framework of application programming interfaces is likely to fuel a wave of innovation and level the playing field for fintechs and technology providers seeking entry through payments or consumer financing.  The trend toward unbundling in financial services is well under way, but where it will lead is still an open question.  In industries such as music, television, e-commerce, and transportation, digital distribution led to unbundling that destroyed value for incumbents in the short term; over time, consumers tend to converge on a single provider—often an attacker.  In this context, firms that effectively orchestrate platform or ecosystem environments tend to eventually emerge as winners.  The balancing act: Omnichannel excellence in retail banking Read the article The history of the music industry over the last 20 years provides a possible model for how things will go in banking.  Until the 1990s, music distribution was dominated by stores selling tracks that record companies “bundled” onto albums.	184.46845312781988
415	143_1-3	Awesome, good to know. How does Open Banking regulation relate to PSD2?	MARCO_59_690617273-7	Practitioners around the globe frequently use ”open banking” as an umbrella term that encompasses both open banking and platform banking. But we believe there are important differences.  Open banking is when a bank, upon a customer’s request, shares customer data with third parties via APIs.  6 Open banking does not use other, less secure methods of data-sharing, such as screen scraping, CSV files, or OCR-readable statements.  There are two types of open APIs: read access, which only gives access to account information, or write access, which enables payments.  7 Open banking can be mandated through government regulations, as it is in the United Kingdom and the European Union Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), or its adoption can be industry-driven, as is the case now in the United States. 8 Open banking is built upon the premise that customers own the data they generate and have the right to direct banks to share their data with others they trust.  While it was designed to give customers more choice, open banking may end up making customers better understand and appreciate the value of one of their key assets: their data.	184.27465054871573
416	143_1-3	Awesome, good to know. How does Open Banking regulation relate to PSD2?	MARCO_46_393414303-17	· The introduction and implementation of both Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and the Open API standards and data sharing remedy from the UK Competition and Markets Authority following its Retail Banking Market Investigation Order (together 'Open Banking') from January 2018 with delivery across 2019 provides third parties and banks with opportunities to change and enhance the relationship between a customer and their bank. It does this by providing customers with the ability to share their transactional data with authorised third-party service providers either for aggregation or payment services.  It is anticipated that both aggregation and payment services will be offered by third parties to Barclay Group's customers and Barclays Group itself has launched an aggregation service.  PSD2 will also introduce new requirements to the authentication process for a number of actions customers take, including ecommerce transactions.  A failure to comply with Open Banking requirements could expose Barclays Group to regulatory sanction.  Further, the data sharing regime could mean that actions or omissions by third-party service providers could expose Barclays Group to potential financial loss from third-party fraud, misuse of customer data, litigation and reputational detriment, amongst other things.  The changes to authentication may change the fraud environment across the industry as providers implement different approaches to comply.	183.5405705461526
417	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_59_690617273-3	Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.	391.5935032158905

Open banking The debate over access to financial data has already been hashed out in the European Union and the United Kingdom.  So-called “open banking” laws now require banks to make it easier to export your data, and pick up and move to a new bank.  Advocates say it gives non-banking start-ups the chance to compete with incumbents and gives consumers more choice over financial products and services.  Across the EU, the revised Payment Services Directive, or PSD2 requires banks to share customers’ data with each other through the same standard, known as an API.  In the U.K., the Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA has mandated that the country’s biggest banks also adopt an open banking standard.  Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration during the Obama years, said the PNC-Venmo spat shows “how much we need to adopt opening banking” that “lets customers own their own data and permission it to be used by regulated third parties through standard protocols.”	350.4616562704214
420	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_56_419159361-14	This not only suggests to organizations that there is little revenue potential, but it also mean that it would be expensive to develop such a market. Consequently, relatively few organizations invest in and experiment with new products based on the new technology brought about through technological discontinuity.  For example, When Amazon started selling books online Barnes and Nobles and other brick and mortar booksellers discounted the new technology model and now Barnes and Nobles may be on the brink of bankruptcy.  Barnes and Nobles, Borders and other bookseller also believe that not many books will want to buy books online.  How can you buy what you have not seen?  The banking industry is also another example.  Although on-line technology has existed for some time, until recently on-line product innovation in the banking industry has been slow in coming.  One cause has been the difficulty in adapting banking to on-line technology.  Banks have to develop user software application, terminal equipment, and sophisticated communications facilities to mesh the technology into a product that consumers could easily use and also be able to have enough security built into the applications to protect users and bank’s asset.  Banks probably also believed that consumers would want personal contact with a human banker, due to the relative complexity and risk associated with financial products.	155.81117115753295

423	143_1-9	No, I meant what kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking in general?	MARCO_05_1138054887-4	historical usage of general English general (adjective and noun) comes via Old French from the Latin adjective generālis “common, belonging to all, belonging to a race or genus” (as opposed to speciālis “particular, belong to a species”). The military sense of general (noun) dates from the mid-16th century; general officer and general of the army date from the mid-17th century.  The heads of some Roman Catholic religious orders are called generals, a usage that began in the 16th century and applied originally to the Jesuits but now applies to the Franciscans and Dominicans as well; the usage was extended in the 19th century to the head of the Salvation Army.  The phrase in general originally meant “in a body, collectively” (a sense that is now obsolete), with a clear relation to the sense of the adjective general “with respect to a whole class, group, or category.”  It later developed further to mean “usually,” which can be interpreted as meaning “as a general rule (rather than a specific instance).”	394.9639822234576

MARCO_50_1983259728-100	Some examples of specific checks and balances are the idea behind the President being the “commander-in-chief”, while Congress had the ability to declare war (it’s worth nothing that the definition behind what exactly being “commander-in-chief” entailed and whether military powers were shared reciprocally or separately, along with the definition of what “declaring war” would constitute in the current status quo - does it mean simply using military force or fighting a nation formally with the intent of pretty much destroying it or something along the lines of that?), as well as the ability of Congress to create laws, while the President has the ability to veto them. This leads me to my next point which I created right now because I realized that when you said ‘constitution’, you meant a constitution in general, and not the U.S. constitution.  Basically constitutions in general are meant to set the whole structure of the government and give the people rights and whatnot.  Some example would include the Spanish, South African, British (though it’s not explicitly referred to as a constitution, but it serves the same purpose), South Korean, and even North Korean constitution.	252.78100671974244

The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which adds to the market uncertainty.  Investing everything in a single cryptocurrency is a very bad idea, because a better version really could replace bitcoin at the top of the heap.  I'm not saying that this will happen but the risk is not zero percent.  If you're investing in cryptocurrencies today, it's probably best to divide your holdings between bitcoin and a few other respectable names such as Ethereum and Litecoin.  All the major names happen to be falling today, but their performance can vary widely from time to time.  Don't cry for the bitcoin specialists, though.  With the exception of the micro-cap Ebang International, all of them have performed extremely well during the current bitcoin boom.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust gained 347% over the last 52 weeks and MicroStrategy rose 331% over the same period.  CleanSpark's stock posted a 614% gain.  And if you thought those results were impressive, we haven't even talked about Riot Blockchain's 1,964% return or Marathon's crushing 2,374% gains.  All of that is after going through Friday's significant haircuts.  John Young , Co-founder, CEO at Cryptosheets (2017-present)	184.37015000487736

While there has been no statement yet from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the $530 million hack that attacked Japanese exchange Coincheck on January 26, 2018, targeted Singaporean-based NEM coins.  India India, once viewed as a burgeoning, friendly environment for cryptocurrencies, has been clamping down on cryptocurrencies in 2018.  India’s tough stance stems from similar concerns that other, more stringent regulatory regimes have cited: money laundering, illegal activity proliferation, sponsorship of terrorism, tax evasion, etc.  While the cash-reliant country is facing stern regulations, participants of the local cryptocurrency industry do not believe India can “ban” cryptocurrencies through regulations in the same way China has.  Australia In the wake of the August 2017 financial scandal surrounding the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Australian government sought to follow in Japan’s footsteps by strengthening its anti-money laundering laws and regulating digital currencies.	172.775489800184

On December 4, 2017, The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that the U.K. Treasury and the EU both had made plans aimed at ending anonymity for cryptocurrency traders, citing anti-money laundering and tax evasion crackdowns.  The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions.  Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.”  The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [  cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”  While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	171.80899296765529

It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch.  The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets.  Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing.  However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult.  The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.  Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage.  Falcon Heavy at the Cape pic.twitter.com/hizfDVsU7X — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2017 Based on Musk’s photos, all the rocket is missing is the payload.  SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board.  Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking.  Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though.  The Falcon heavy launch is currently scheduled for some time in January, which is not an optimal Mars transfer timeframe, by the way.	155.05130435273713
442	144_1-1	What does SpaceX's rocket engine reusability mean and why do they care?	KILT_31406060-1	Falcon Heavy  The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.  The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle, the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched (behind the Saturn V and Energia).   SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).  The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, as a dummy payload.  The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth.   The Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, although , Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.  The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the Starship and Super Heavy launch system.   Section::::History.

443	144_1-1	What does SpaceX's rocket engine reusability mean and why do they care?	KILT_56515839-5	Falcon Heavy flew in its reusable configuration, allowing for a landing approach of both side boosters and the central core.  The side boosters consisted of two previously flown Falcon 9 first stages, being reused from the CRS-9 mission in July 2016 and the Thaicom 8 launch in May 2016.  The central core was newly built because it needs to support stronger forces during ascent, so that a regular first stage could not be used.  The upper stage was the same as on a Falcon 9.   Side boosters equipped with a nose cone have different aerodynamic properties than the usual Falcon 9 boosters with a cylindric interstage.  For this reason, SpaceX equipped them with larger and sturdier grid fins made of titanium, to help guide the atmospheric descent accurately.  The central core, however, still used conventional aluminum grid fins, as its aerodynamic properties are very similar to those of a conventional Falcon 9 first stage.   The Roadster was mounted on the second stage using a custom-made payload adapter, and was encapsulated in a conventional fairing.  Falcon Heavy also supports the launch of Dragon capsules without a fairing.   Section::::Mission overview.:Objectives.	124.55353174218908
444	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.  Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	158.12459836504422
445	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_2647515-14	The first version of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, Falcon 9 v1.0, was an expendable launch vehicle that was developed in 2005–2010, and was launched for the first time in 2010. Falcon 9 v1.0 made five flights in 2010–2013, after which it was retired.   The Falcon 9 v1.0 first stage was powered by nine SpaceX Merlin 1C rocket engines arranged in a 3×3 pattern.  Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of for a total thrust on liftoff of about .  The Falcon 9 v1.0 second stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345 seconds.  Gaseous N thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system.   SpaceX expressed hopes initially that both stages would eventually be reusable.  But early results from adding lightweight thermal protection system capability to the booster stage and using parachute recovery were not successful, leading to abandonment of that approach and the initiation of a new design.  In 2011, SpaceX began a formal and funded development program for a reusable Falcon 9, with the early program focus however on return of the first stage.

Falcon 9 v1.1 SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft, lifts off during the COTS Demo Flight 1 on 8 December 2010 Main article: Falcon 9 v1.1 On 8 September 2005, SpaceX announced the development of the Falcon 9 rocket, which has nine Merlin engines in its first stage.  The design is an EELV -class vehicle, intended to compete with the Delta IV and the Atlas V, along with launchers of other nations as well.  Both stages were designed for reuse.  A similarly designed Falcon 5 rocket was also envisioned to fit between the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9, but development was dropped to concentrate on the Falcon 9.  The first version of the Falcon 9, Falcon 9 v1.0, was developed in 2005–2010, and flew five orbital missions in 2010–2013.  The second version of the launch system— Falcon 9 v1.1 — has been retired meanwhile.  Falcon 9 v1.1 was developed in 2010-2013, and made its maiden flight in September 2013.	154.14871309697628

KILT_34666187-1	SpaceX reusable launch system development program  The SpaceX reusable launch system development program is a privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times in a manner similar to the reusability of aircraft.  The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.   The reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets.	212.7626169794239

449	144_2-1	What are SpaceX's plans for rocket reusability?	MARCO_18_3116878569-6	"In 2012, it was projected that the first-stage separation of a reusable Falcon 9 rocket would occur at a velocity of approximately Mach 6 (4,600 mph; 2.0 km/s) rather than Mach 10 (7,600 mph; 3.4 km/s) for an expendable Falcon 9, to provide the residual fuel necessary for the deceleration and turnaround maneuver and the controlled descent and landing. In November 2012, CEO Elon Musk announced SpaceX's plans to build a second, much larger, reusable rocket system, this one to be powered by LOX / methane rather than LOX/ RP-1 used on Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.  The new system was to be ""an evolution of SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster"", and SpaceX reiterated their commitment to develop a breakthrough in vertical landing technology.  By the end of 2012, the demonstration test vehicle, Grasshopper, had made three VTVL test flights—including a 29-second hover flight to 40 meters (130 ft) on December 17, 2012.

In the SpaceX post, I talked about the Falcon 9’s nine Merlin engines, and how each one was powerful enough to lift a stack of 40 cars up into the sky—in total, that meant the Falcon 9 set of engines could lift 360 cars.  The Falcon Heavy, with its 27 Merlin engines, could lift a stack of over 1,000 cars up past the clouds.  2 The Big Fucking Booster sits atop a different kind of engine: the Raptor.  The Raptor engine looks a lot like a Merlin, with one key difference—by significantly increasing the pressure, SpaceX has made the Raptor over three times more powerful than a Merlin.  A single Raptor engine produces 310 tons of thrust—enough to lift 310 tons, or a stack of 172 cars, or an entire Boeing 747 airplane, into the sky.  That’s what one Raptor can do.  3 And the BFB has 42 of them.  4 All together, that’s an unheard of 13,033 tons of thrust, enough to push more than 7,000 cars—or 50 large airplanes—up to space.	133.30199808990437
452	144_2-3	Tell me more about the rocket engines for Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Dragon, and Starship.	MARCO_27_1146612109-3	Together, these engines have been running for over 400,000 seconds, enough power to launch 3,600 tonnes into space, which equates to the weight of 7 ISS. Use of Merlin engines RP-1, a petroleum derivative similar to kerosene and liquid oxygen as materials to produce rocket propulsion.  The Falcon 9 takes its name from the nine Merlin engines used.  According to the technical data of the Falcon 9, which takes its name from the nine Merlin engines used, these engines have a thrust of 650 kN, a Specific vacuum pulse 311s and a 63.5 ton rise in sea level.  Design details for the Merlin 1D engine were not openly shared by SpaceX, but the company said the Falcon 9 was « the world’s most powerful operational rocket.  , by a factor of two ”.  In November 2013, Elon Musk explained that the engine was running at 85% of its potential and that these numbers could be improved.  The result came with the Falcon 9 v1.1, which in addition to changing the placement of the nine engines, has evolved into the Merlin 1D empty.  Falcon 9 v1.0 (left) vs Falcon 9 v1.1 with Merlin 1D Vacuum engines (right).  The latest Merlin 1D vacuum motors have a pushing capacity 80 tons, with a specific impulse of 348 seconds.	113.69812377437484
453	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	217.6192135662859
454	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel.  However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant.  So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene?  SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines.  And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature.  It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).  It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets.  When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars.  However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable.  So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	181.16131115248567
455	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_17_3581880174-11	Methane In November 2012, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced plans to develop liquid methane /LOX rocket engines. It had previously used only RP-1 /LOX in SpaceX rocket engines.  As of March 2014  [  update] , SpaceX was developing the Raptor methalox bipropellant rocket engine, which by 2016 was predicted to generate 3,000 kN (670,000 lbf) of thrust.  The engine is slated to be used on a future super-heavy rocket, the Starship.  Although it has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen, liquid methane can be produced on Mars via the Sabatier reaction and is easier to store than liquid hydrogen due to its higher boiling point and density, as well as its lack of hydrogen embrittlement.  It also leaves less residue in the engines compared to kerosene, which is beneficial for reusability.  In July 2014, Firefly Space Systems announced their plans to use methane fuel for their small satellite launch vehicle, Firefly Alpha with an aerospike engine design.  In September 2014, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance announced the joint development of the BE-4 LOX/LNG engine.  The BE-4 will provide 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) of thrust.

456	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	226.29068032425857
457	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_18_3116444373-12	"Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011–2015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene—methane is cleaner burning—and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to ""live off the land"" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015.  76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April–August 2015.  SpaceX completed its planned testing using NASA Stennis facilities in 2014 and 2015.  In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around 230 tonnes-force (2,300 kN; 510,000 lb f ), much lower than older statements had mentioned.  By August 2015, an Elon Musk statement surfaced that indicated the oxidizer to fuel ratio of the engine would be approximately 3.8 to 1."	211.03723709746555
458	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-5	It’s melting point is -259°C or -435°F, and its boiling point is -252°C or -423°F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.	161.62352142328018

460	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_16_1811109911-25	Yet another solution was specified in a proposal for a Mach 3 reconnaissance Phantom. This was pre-compressor cooling, albeit available for relatively short duration.  Hydrogen-fuelled air-breathing jet engines Jet engines can be run on almost any fuel.  Hydrogen is a highly desirable fuel, as, although the energy per mole is not unusually high, the molecule is very much lighter than other molecules.  The energy per kg of hydrogen is twice that of more common fuels and this gives twice the specific impulse.  In addition, jet engines running on hydrogen are quite easy to build—the first ever turbojet was run on hydrogen.  Also, although not duct engines, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines have seen extensive use.  However, in almost every other way, hydrogen is problematic.  The downside of hydrogen is its density; in gaseous form the tanks are impractical for flight, but even in the form of liquid hydrogen it has a density one fourteenth that of water.  It is also deeply cryogenic and requires very significant insulation that precludes it being stored in wings.  The overall vehicle would end up being very large, and difficult for most airports to accommodate.  Finally, pure hydrogen is not found in nature, and must be manufactured either via steam reforming or expensive electrolysis.	186.019239397785
461	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_06_603902257-3	"These make hydrogen engines particularly prone to pre-ignition. The situation is further aggravated by hydrogen's high flame speed.  Pre-ignition leads to harmful flashbacks into the carburetor and rough operation and is believed to be due to the development of surface ""hot spots.""  Induction ignition can occur due to excessive temperatures of both combustion chamber components and small surface deposits or suspended particles.  Hydrogen's exceptionally low ignition energy requires that the average temperature prevailing within the combustion space during induction be sufficiently low so that the formation of hot spots is avoided.  This requires appropriate cooling of the cylinder head, piston, valves, combustion chamber wall, and the use of cold spark plugs (non-platinum tipped spark plugs).  One way to reduce the effect of combustion chamber hot spots on the pre-ignition of a fresh charge is to use thermal dilution techniques.  The unusual heat and mass transfer characteristics of hydrogen make it almost necessary to rethink the combustion chamber and cooling system design so that hydrogen's unique attributes can be capitalized on to full advantage.  Another important issue regarding the engine operation, especially with near stoichiometric hydrogen and air mixtures, is the extent of NOx formation."	165.05299684943748

Section::::History.   In the first ten years of SpaceX, the company developed a variety of liquid-propellant rocket engines, with at least one more of that type under development.   , each of the engines developed to date—Kestrel, Merlin 1, Draco and Super Draco—had been developed for initial use in the SpaceX Falcon family of launch vehicles—Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy—or for the Dragon capsule.  Each main engine developed by 2012 has been Kerosene-based, using RP-1 as the fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer, while the RCS control thruster engines have used storable hypergolic propellants.   In November 2012, at a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, United Kingdom, SpaceX announced that they plan to develop methane-based engines for their future rockets.  These engines will use staged cycle combustion, for higher efficiency similar to the system used on the former Soviet Union's NK-33 engine.   By mid-2015, SpaceX had developed a total of 9 rocket engines architectures in the first 13 years of the company's existence.	178.16856726200783

MARCO_22_1413901484-2	"This means that both engines have roughly the same outer dimensions: the 429 is 34 inches by 30 inches by 30 inches, and the 460 is 34 inches by 27 inches by 30 inches. These massive engines certainly weighed plenty, however.  The 429 weighed in at 635 pounds, while the 460 was an incredible 720 pounds, living up to its ""big block"" heritage.  Obviously, the physical size of the engine displacement is reflected in the names of the engines.  Production Run Though both engines began their lives in 1968, the 429 was discontinued in 1973, while the 460 lasted all the way until 1996, seeing use exclusively in trucks.  However, in 1973, the 460 underwent a massive change, dropping from a robust 365 horsepower to a paltry 209 horsepower.  It was finally discontinued due to demands for a more efficient engine to respond to the newly environmentally aware consumers.  Stroke Length This is where most of the difference between the engines is made up.  The 429, with less displacement volume, had a shorter stroke length of 3.59, meaning it produced less power per camshaft rotation than the 460, which had a stroke length of 3.85, as mentioned above.  The longer stroke produces more power and also allows for more and better high-performance modifications."	265.5479447906164

But, due to the simple fact that they’re sedans, they don’t have that much room, especially compared to the roomiest Honda models like the Odyssey.  CarGurus says that both cars can seat five people and both offer roughly similar front and back legroom at about 40 inches.

The Honda Accord | Raymond Boyd/Getty Images While the Honda Accord and the Civic have a lot in common, the Accord is still a larger sedan than the Civic is.  As a result, a lot of their differences are a result of that size difference.  For instance, despite having engines that are the same size, the Accord’s engine is more powerful than the Civic’s.  CarGurus says that the Accord’s engine gets 192 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque, while the Civic gets 174 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque.	187.50392965254923

474	144_2-17	Why do open cycle rocket engines exhaust fuel?	MARCO_19_1767990244-25	Due to the laws of thermodynamics, as air is compressed, it is heated up. The air in the bow shock compresses so much it actually turns into a plasma.  This plasma can be about half as hot as the surface of the Sun.  Superheavy Bowshock So in order to avoid having this burning hot plasma destroy the rocket, the Falcon 9 will again light up 3 of its 9 Merlin engines to slow itself down just as it begins to really experience those extreme atmospheric temperatures.  This not only slows the booster down, but it also basically creates a “force field” in front of the booster, providing a boundary of exhaust gas which is a lot cooler than the plasma.  Without this step, the Falcon 9 booster would likely not survive the reentry process.  Parachute recovery attempts After all, SpaceX tried to recover the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 boosters using parachutes for the first few flights, which kept failing, likely due to a complete lack of additional heat shielding.  By the time the booster was supposed to deploy the parachutes it was too late.  Because it is hard to deploy parachutes when you are in a million flaming pieces.  But again as we mentioned before, this is something that stainless steel should allow the SuperHeavy booster to forgo which will save fuel and thereby increase overall performance.	199.99397291495097

Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it’s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX’s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4).	214.08707264921395

MARCO_01_686831562-18	76] Technical feasibility Prior to the reusability program's success in December 2015, the return of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished, and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility. And even after this success, the rapid reuse of a rocket has not been attempted.  Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.  [  6  ]  [  77] Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.  [  78] Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return, vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin.  A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an expendable configuration.  Although the reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets [  28] it is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation.	182.28826542396564
479	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_23_1123984842-4	Reusability – Rockets are designed to have two or three “stages”. The first stage is the actual rocket.  The rocket detaches itself from the rest of the ship and doesn’t actually make it to orbit.  The problem is most rockets are only designed for single-use.  Once it does its job of propelling the payload into orbit, it becomes a very expensive, gigantic tin can.  Very few parts of the rocket are salvaged and reused for the next launch.  Reusable rockets will help reduce costs of space launches significantly but they are complex to build and design so it might take a while to perfect them.  SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is the first system that has managed to have a reusable first-stage.  Development cost – There’s little room for error when it comes to launching things into space.  One small error will put lives and millions of dollars in expensive equipment in danger.  More importantly, human lives.  Designing and building rockets is a big challenge and one that must not be taken lightly.  This is why thousands and thousands of hours have to go into developing the technology and materials that make space travel possible.  Then, all that needs to be tested and re-tested many times on the ground.	147.07577181013767

Sadly, the Great Barrier Reef has lost half its coral since 1985.  The damage is happening so fast scientists can’t keep up.  Corals have died off because of pollution, invasive species and a process called coral bleaching, according to Science magazine.  The water on the planet is simply getting too warm for corals to survive but, according to an article published by Nature on Nov. 27, 2019, scientists are protecting the more resilient reefs while nursing others back to health.	149.50613784883717

MARCO_13_1702160838-2	Instead, I worry and fight for the actual existence of coral reefs as we know them, as the changes I see are happening all too quickly—much quicker than the reef can adapt .” This is because over the last two years, the Great Barrier Reef, which is so dear to Miller and countless others who revel in the beauty and mysteries of the oceans, has been dying off at an unprecedented rate due primarily to warming ocean waters.  Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by warmer-than-normal water, causing them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues, from which they get their energy.  Coral turns completely white when it bleaches.  If it remains bleached long enough, it dies.  One scientist has already gone so far as to declare the Great Barrier Reef is now in a “ terminal stage .”  Most of those studying the reef agree that what is happening is unprecedented.  This is because, at a minimum, two-thirds of the 1,400-mile long reef bleached out last year, which led to 22 percent of it dying.  Now another bleaching event has resulted in at least two-thirds of the reef bleached again.	148.97222429412795

The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly.  For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior.  It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart.  Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe.  A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea.  As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae.  “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.  Lewis and his colleague Luke Nothdurft published their observations recently in the journal Coral Reefs.  Coral provide shelter for the tiny photosynthesizing organisms, which in turn produce excess sugar that the animals can eat.  Without that food supply, coral may starve.	141.75991025398798

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	190.3082103707129

This what-if question is not some farfetched scenario.  The threats to coral and coral reefs — which include climate change, pollution, coastal development, fishing and the creation of jewelry and souvenirs — are very real.  In fact, live, growing coral on Caribbean reefs has declined to just 8 percent of the reefs' composition, compared with more than 50 percent in the 1970s [  source: IUCN Facts ].  So what happens if the coral reefs vanish completely?  Some experts predict hunger, poverty and political instability as the livelihoods of the peoples of entire countries disappear.  Once the coral is dead, the reefs will also die and erode, destroying important marine life spawning and feeding grounds.  Animals that rely on coral for protection and cover, such as grouper, snapper, oysters and clams, would also be negatively impacted.  And because this marine life is a vital staple in many peoples' diets, the death of the coral reefs would exacerbate the problem of feeding these groups [  source: Skoloff ].	114.20609442685964

Conservation By: Eva Gruber With the recent tragic news of the Great Barrier Reef experiencing the largest mass coral bleaching event ever, we can no longer ignore the fact that coral reefs the world over are in sheer danger.  Coral reef ecosystems take centuries to grow and develop, and it is no small matter to be losing them due to anthropogenic activities in a matter of years.  At least 19% of the world’s coral reefs – including 50% of those in the Caribbean – are already gone, and within 20 years, if current trends continue, we could lose another 15%, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

That means all the global coral reef system – with all of its biodiversity and fisheries supporting millions of poor people around the world – will be wiped out.  There will be cascading effects on the rest of the ocean’s marine habitats as well, and as a result there will be widespread hunger, poverty, and political instability.	113.50819034536836
486	145_1-5	What is the impact of dead corals on humans?	MARCO_16_3676861391-25	The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.  The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.  Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.  Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves.  Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life.  Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.  Climate change impacts on the environment Ecological collapse.  Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide.  Extreme weather.

488	145_1-5	What is the impact of dead corals on humans?	MARCO_22_1063811612-3	You can now see them bleaching from vibrant colors to bland and lifeless ones. It’s only a matter of time until the last coral vanishes from the oceans.  But what if an abrupt heatwave destroyed all of the reefs overnight?  Coral reefs take up just 1% of the world’s marine environment.  So, no big deal, right?  Wrong.  Just that 1% is enough to sustain a quarter of all marine animals in the ocean.  Two million species live in, on, and around the reefs.  For them, corals have been providing food and shelter for 50 million years.  The day the reefs disappeared, marine biodiversity would suffer huge losses.  The ocean bottom would be taken over by forests of seaweed.  Maybe it’s time to give jellyfish soup a try, since there would be plenty of them in the ocean.  But for many unique species of fish in the ocean, corals are their only safe habitat.  A lot of them would be lost for good.  Same goes for sea turtles.  Since coral are filter feeders, they clean the water.  Remaining species, including dolphins, would be left to survive in very murky waters.  They might soon disappear as well, since when the corals disappear, there would be very little fish for them to feed on.	202.30491249257463
489	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	286.5054546621391
490	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_58_1622110619-2	In addition to these opportunities, a range of ocean-based carbon removal approaches could help capture and store billion of tons of carbon. Importantly, these approaches would not increase ocean acidification.  The ocean currently absorbs just under one-third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, which is contributing to a rise in ocean acidification and making it more difficult for organisms like oysters and corals to build shells.  A few options for increasing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon may also provide co-benefits, such as increasing biodiversity and reducing acidification.  However, many approaches remain contentious due to uncertainties around potential ecological impacts, governance and other risks.  If research efforts increase to improve understanding in these areas, a combination of approaches could help address the global climate crisis.  Ocean-based Ways to Remove CO 2 from the Atmosphere Proposed methods for increasing the ocean’s ability to remove and store carbon dioxide — including biological, chemical and electrochemical concepts — vary in technical maturity, permanence, public acceptance and risk.  Note: This graphic represents the general types of proposed approaches, but may not reflect every proposal.  1.  Biological Approaches Biological approaches, which leverage the power of photosynthesis to capture CO 2, offer a few approaches for carbon removal.	202.73581587300623
491	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_28_1826458276-5	I say 'almost' because the rate of photosynthesis exceeds the rate of cellular respiration. However, some of that difference is made up for by wildfires that burn plant matter and release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, much like cellular respiration does.  Wildfires make up for most of that difference, but not quite.  A very small amount of organic material is buried under sediment and taken out of the short-term carbon cycle that cycles carbon between living organisms, the atmosphere and the surface of the oceans.  This buried organic material may eventually be turned into fossil fuels, but that's not the only way that carbon can be taken out of the short-term carbon cycle.  Coral reefs take carbon out of the short-term carbon cycle to form calcium carbonate exoskeletons  Believe it or not, on a net basis, coral reefs actually take the most carbon out of the short-term carbon cycle.  This is achieved by the formation of calcium carbonate exoskeletons, which do not release carbon back into the water, but instead remain in a solid form and eventually form limestone.  The largest pool of carbon in the world is actually in the sediments of the deep ocean which are estimated to contain about 50 times the carbon that is currently in the atmosphere.	155.38629511849285
492	145_2-1	What happens when corals die and the carbon falls into the ocean?	MARCO_39_1141658031-5	This   substance   is   used   to   produce   shells   and   other   body   parts   by   organisms   such   as   coral,   clams,   oysters,   some   protozoa,   and   some   algae.   When   these   organisms   die,   their   shells   and   body   parts   sink   to   the   ocean   floor   where   they   accumulate   as   carbonate-rich   deposits.    After   long   periods   of   time,   these   deposits   are   physically   and   chemically   altered   into   sedimentary   rocks.    Ocean   deposits   are   by   far   the   biggest   sinks   of   carbon   on   the   planet.    Carbon   is   released   from   ecosystems   as   carbon   dioxide   gas   by   the   process   of   respiration.

493	145_2-1	What happens when corals die and the carbon falls into the ocean?	MARCO_20_666561210-3	As we’ve mentioned, calcium carbonate is one of the ways that CO2 is taken out of the ocean, and that is because it becomes apart of shells, corals and other marine life. When any of these die, they end up on the ocean floor.  So over millions and millions of years, the dead marine life moves with the tectonic plates.  Under heat and pressure, this calcium carbonate ends up becoming rocks (such as limestone), so we end up with a lot of CO2 eventually ending up in stone.  So to sum: CO2 ends up in the oceans (which is already where most of it is contained), some gets formed into shells and corals which end up as stone or fuel (organic matter over millions of years), and by using this organic matter we’re pumping it back into the atmosphere.  As such, it seems quite reasonable that we should just be able to pump it back into the oceans to help keep this cycle continuing for millions of years more.  However, we’ve found that an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean increases the pH levels.  For anyone that has ever had a tropical fish in a tank, they well understand how important it is to keep the correct pH levels.

MARCO_36_1480232399-5	The final stage of the pump is when these clusters of dead phytoplankton reach the ocean floor where they, and the CO2 they contain, remain for thousands of years. Role of Calcium Carbonate Calcium Carbonate is the primary ingredient that Clams, oysters, coral, and other hard-bodied aquatic creatures depend on to create their hard shells.  This carbon compound is produced by carbon dioxide combining with calcium that has previously been dissolved in seawater.  When these organisms die, their body parts and shells sink deep into the ocean to the seafloor, thus hiding, or burying, carbon.  Over a long period of time, these dead organisms create carbonate-rich deposit layers on the floor of the ocean.  After millions of years have passed, more and more carbonates form, which then creates heat and pressure that causes them to turn into sedimentary rocks.  This includes chalk, marble, and limestone.

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.  How many different species live in reefs?  What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms.  Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology.  When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs.  5.  Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	246.42846203121007

498	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	MARCO_54_341156451-4	By 2016, bleaching occurred once every 5.9 years. That’s an almost five-fold increase in coral bleaching in the past 40 years.  More than half of 100 reefs studied lost more than 30% of their corals in 2015 or 2016.  10 Ocean Acidification Shellfish and coral reefs suffer serious damage from ocean acidification also caused by global warming.  Scientists estimate 25% of all carbon emitted goes into the oceans.  11 ﻿ The increase in carbon dioxide changes the chemical makeup of the water.  This in turn causes the pH levels to fall, thus making the water more acidic.  Since the 1800s, the pH level has fallen by 0.1 pH units.  It doesn't sound like much, but the pH scale is logarithmic like the Richter scale that measures earthquakes.  As a result, it represents a 30% increase in acidity.  12 ﻿ This is an alarming trend that creates a toxic environment for ocean wildlife.& nbsp; Effects on the Economy The most devastating economic fallout from water pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, occurs in four main areas: 13 ﻿ Cost of treating drinking water Losses to tourism (swimming, snorkeling, boating) Damage to commercial fishing and shellfish harvests Lower real estate values Let’s examine these in more detail.	139.80577521738087

""Three severe bleaching events in five years is not something we anticipated happening until the middle of the century.""  Climate change could kill all of Earth's coral reefs by 2100, scientists warn Warm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching, which is when corals turn white as a stress response to water that is too warm.  This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color.  Read More Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately.  But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.  Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching.  What he saw was unprecedented.  ""For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,"" he said.  Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching."	139.1227546363316

The third bleaching occurred only five years after the second.  This means that half the world’s corals died over just 30 years.  Why corals turn white Coral bleaching is one of the consequences of global warming, i.e. the rise in the global temperatures of both air and oceans caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, CO2) released into the atmosphere by human-related activities such as the burning of petroleum and coal.  According to the documentary, 93 per cent the heat released into the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean.  Without our oceans, we’ll be doomed.  Indeed, we would be already experiencing a temperature of 50 degrees, rather than talking about a 3-degree increase in the average temperature by the end of the century.  Corals in the American Samoa© XL Catlin Seaview Survey/The Ocean Agency/Richard Vevers And the first proofs of warming oceans and ocean acidification are coral bleaching and the death of corals.  Corals turn white because they get sick.  And their reaction to this “fever” is turning white, almost fluorescent, like they’re signalling their state of health.	133.53898164195198
501	146_1-1	What's the difference between bike packing and bike touring?	MARCO_18_438706474-27	Bikepacking Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.  Risks Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking, free ride and dirt jumping.	345.9988449684315

The Basics Given that this is our complete guide to bikepacking bags, we’ll begin with a few definitions for beginners.  Let’s first clarify the difference between bikepacking and bike touring.  Although neither are mutually exclusive — and there’s inevitably plenty of overlap — the two often diverge in the style of travel they encourage.  Traditional touring tends to be enjoyed on heavily laden bikes, and as a result, often gravitates towards paved routes and byways.  Minimal in style, modern bikepacking is based more on the exploration of off-pavement roads, backcountry trails, and singletrack.  Furthermore, the two are largely differentiated by the style of bag setup they’re associated with, and the bikes that are used.  Traditional touring uses racks and panniers; as a result, touring bikes bikes are designed for this purpose.  The beauty of bikepacking is in its simplicity: any bike can be a bikepacking bike.  Thanks to the advent of soft bags, bikepacking doesn’t depend on a particular frame having eyelets for racks and panniers.  Full-suspension, carbon, ‘cross, hardtail, fat, rigid — almost any bike will do.	294.31651957482245

The stark difference between the two, though, is the presence of pavement.  Bike touring sticks to roads, but where the pavement ends, bikepacking begins.  By abandoning asphalt, the bikepacker loses many associated byproducts as well: the presence of vehicles, crowds of people, and the infrastructure of cities and towns.  In turn, the bikepacker gains what a road tour ride can’t always provide: wild scenery, challenging terrain, and rugged solitude.  As bikepacking gains traction, it’s becoming easier to get into, with the emergence of sturdy specialty bikes, lightweight travel gear, and a network of tested routes.

504	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_19_1932497705-2	If you’re just starting out, this can all be a bit confusing. My goal with this post is to help you understand how these two different systems – rack and panniers versus bikepacking bags – work, and how to approach choosing from amongst the wonderful array of options for your next pedal-powered adventure.  Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).	246.6472077810904

The purpose of bikepacking bags and panniers is to carry luggage on your bike.  Generally speaking, bikepacking bags are made for off-road use while panniers and racks are made for road riding.  Racks and panniers are generally preferred by bicycle tourists who need to carry all of the necessities for weeks, months, or even years on the road.  Most bicycle tourists spend more time riding on the pavement and travel long distances.  Often internationally.  Bikepacking bags are often preferred by those who spend more time riding off-pavement, on long stretches of gravel roads, and single track through rural or wilderness regions.  Most bikepackers take a minimalist approach to packing to keep the bike lightweight and agile.  What are Bikepacking Bags?  Bikepacking bags are soft bags that attach directly to the frame of the bike with straps and Velcro.  No metal racks are needed.  A wide range of bikepacking bags have hit the market to fit different sizes and styles of bikes.  You can find bikepacking bags that will fit pretty much every frame.  Many manufacturers are happy to build custom bags for you as well.	200.2514272951521
506	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_06_890080970-6	Most pannier racks sit over the back wheel, attached to the bike near the rear wheel axle and rear brake bridge. Pannier bags then clip on either side.  There are options for extra bags that sit on top of the rack, or you can leave it empty and simply strap extra cargo to the top.  Some bikes also have fittings for racks either side of the front wheel which can hold bags as well.  The bags themselves have a firm back for structure with clips that securely hold onto the metal frame of the racks.  Pannier bags are water resistant or waterproof and are constructed from tough materials to protect your things in the event of a crash.  Many feature handy straps for carrying the bags by hand once you get to your destination and reflective detailing to help you stay seen in low light.  Pannier bags can carry more any cycling rucksack and there is no more comfortable way to carry a heavy load - after all, it's the bike carrying it, not you!  Using rucksack might have benefits for off-road handling, but it is not ideal for touring holidays when you are riding for longer with a heavier load.  Cycling is already tough on many people's backs; a heavy rucksack can just make things worse.	170.71914440195542
507	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_13_965581026-24	A mountain bike has different needs from a touring bike, and vice versa, which leads us to the next question. Can You Put a Pannier Rack On a Road Bike Road bikes are not much different from touring bikes, which is why the answer to this question is yes.  You can put a pannier rack on a road bike, or even a mountain bike for that matter, as long as the mounting holes are compatible.  However, you may still have follow-up questions, which is why we’re going to take a closer look at this matter.  A road bike does not have a fixed structure.  Some have eyelets, while others do not.  The length of the chainstay also differs.  Lastly, different materials can be used on the bike, resulting in different weights.  By considering these factors, you can find out how you can put a pannier rack on a road bike and which can be considered as one of the right pannier racks for road bike.  With or without eyelets – To begin with, if your road bike has eyelets, attaching a pannier rack is quite simple.  However, if there’s no eyelet, you should get racks that have clamps or brackets for the seat post.  With this component, installation is much easier but less secure.	116.24707848611251
508	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306906707-6	Can you put panniers on a road bike? You can put panniers on a road bike but you will need a special type of pannier rack to do this.  Since road bikes don’t have the mounting options on the frame (or ‘eyelets’) for adding a rack, you will need to buy a rear rack that attaches to your seat post to put panniers on your road bike.  The only downside to this is that the seat post racks generally have a lighter weight limit given the alternative mounting position.  That being said, on a bike commute you should still have no problems carrying all that you need on a road bike with panniers on a rack fitted in this way.  The same road bike as above with a rear seat-post rack.  This is an option if you want to commute on a road bike and carry panniers.  Road bikes don’t have the pannier rack option because they are designed for speed and are therefore made to be as streamlined as possible.  Adding panniers and a rack are therefore not what road bikes were originally intended for, but don’t let that stop you for your ride to work.

509	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306897671-3	You would need to use bolts that come with your panniers to attach them here. Your rack can then be attached using a few simple tools like hexkey and a wrench, so there is no real need to pay someone to do it, although it would be cheap if you needed to visit your local bike store to ask for help with this.  Do pannier racks fit all bikes?  No, unfortunately not all bikes can have standard pannier racks on them, with most road bikes not being able to hold a standard pannier rack.  That said, you can still buy a special seat-post-mounted rear rack that functions in a similar way to attach to your road bike.  Although this will work for most bike commuters on road bikes, you should be careful not to overload a seat-post-mounted pannier rack since road bikes are designed for speed and are not meant to be weighted down.  It is true that their frames can handle a fair amount of weight, but having this strain on your seat post, combined with it affecting the geometry of your road bike, could make it a little difficult to control your road bike if commuting with weighty pannier bags on the back.	102.80908829983672

So depending on your preference and budget, you should select a bicycle seat that is most appropriate for you.  We hope now you know how to make a bike seat more comfortable.  Keep your bike saddle in the right position, tipped backwards and take the entire seat when sitting.  Don’t sit on the nose of the seat because you won’t feel comfortable there.  There will be excessive pressure on some of your delicate arteries in the lower section.  And it will cause pain and soreness.  When your bike seat is comfortable, you will feel comfortable, and you can ride for long hours.  Using thinner padding and padding apparel is another way to make your bike riding more comfortable.  Making a specifically designed bike cushion can also solve the problem for you.  Just make sure that there is not excessive pressure over any of your muscles in contact with your saddle.	149.08027408225462

(Image credit: Disney/Marvel)  With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect.  There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable.  But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible – we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time.  The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other – so there's loads of choice.

Joe and Anthony Russo's 2018 film began the culmination of the Infinity Saga leading to the events of Avengers: Endgame.  Like its sequel, the film has some of the MCU's best moments, including the God of Thunder's epic arrival on Earth during the third act battle with Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Teenage Groot (Vin Diesel).  While Captain America (Chris Evans) remains on Earth and Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Titan, Thor goes on a side-trip to Nidavellir to get his hands on another powerful weapon that could kill the Mad Titan after Mjölnir's destruction in Thor: Ragnarok.  One of the Nine Realms, Nidavellir is also home of the legendary blacksmith Eitri (Peter Dinklage) who created his powerful hammer as well as Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet.	146.87071002280754
524	147_1-3	Remind me of the elevator scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)	WAPO_3Y2AN7DJORGFDK4PANE5CP6J6I-1	This post discusses the plot of “Avengers: Infinity War” in detail.  I’ve seen “Avengers: Infinity War” twice now, and though much of the film’s cacophony has faded rather quickly, there’s one scene in particular that has stayed with me.  Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the adopted, brutalized daughter of the Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin), has agreed to reveal the location of one of the Infinity Stones that Thanos is searching for to stop him from torturing her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan).  When Gamora and Thanos arrive on the planet Vormir, they meet Red Skull (Ross Marquand, replacing Hugo Weaving), who informs Thanos that it takes more than merely tracking down its location to recover the Soul Stone.  He’ll have to sacrifice something he loves.  For a moment, it seems to Gamora and to us like this might be the fatal flaw in Thanos’s plan: It’s not a mighty hero that will stop him but his inability to truly feel love.  After all, he has tormented both of his daughters in an effort to forge them into unstoppable fighters, and his plan for the universe involves a form of drastic Malthusian population reduction.	144.43710212917358

It can summon the clouds themselves and charge insane lightning bolts toward its enemies, with beings like Iron Man being completely incapacitated with a single attack.  Unfortunately, Hela destroyed it in short order, and we’ve seen powerful beings be able to parry its offense.  But if you apply the worthy clause, no one should be able to lift it at all in a fight.  4 Thanos’ Double-edged Sword This sword went unnamed in Avengers: Endgame, but it’s a shame we didn’t get to find out more about its properties, because the sword was incredibly powerful.  Thanos wielded it with a winning streak of almost a 100-percent, until Scarlet Witch was able to beat him.  RELATED:  Avengers: Endgame Almost Featured A Much Different Version of [  SPOILER]  With Thanos’ strength, the sword was able to destroy a vibranium shield, something no one has ever witnessed in the MCU.

526	147_1-5	I found the “Avengers Assemble” scene in Endgame more powerful than the elevator scene in Winter Soldier	MARCO_30_352398788-11	It’s your standard (and not that great) team-up battle plotline, but the end-credits scene causes a serious dilemma when trying to place it in the MCU timeline. This movie takes place at the same time as Infinity War.  And while I really feel that watching Infinity War and Endgame back-to-back is most powerful, the end-credits scene could be a major spoiler.  It’s also important to Endgame to know where Ant-Man is, so I have to place it in this order for maximum effect.  22.  Avengers: Endgame After Infinity War’s devastating events, the remaining Avengers must find a way to go on.  This movie truly ties in everything we’ve been building towards from the beginning of Phase One, and every piece just seems to finally fall into place.  23.  Spider-Man: Far From Home Following the events of Endgame, Peter is dealing with grief, but just wants a break from his heroic duties to enjoy his school trip to Italy.  Unfortunately for him though, Nick Fury needs him for a mission.  Amidst his crime-fighting, a new hero, Mysterio, shows up to help.  Spider-Man: Far From Home is the official end of Marvel’s Phase Three. 24.	176.8328955214165
527	147_1-5	I found the “Avengers Assemble” scene in Endgame more powerful than the elevator scene in Winter Soldier	MARCO_50_2209194864-24	I enjoyed Endgame. I loved Captain America being worthy and fighting off Thanos I loved Peter Parker’s reunite with Tony Stark I loved Captain America saying Avengers Assemble, and the portal scene I loved Tony Stark outsmarting Thanos, and becoming the first mortal to use the Infinity Stones.  I think this movie is really good, I really do.  But this movie isn’t flawless, it’s not perfect.  I don’t think RDJ deserves an Oscar nomination, I don’t think this movie is as good as Shawshank redemption, or Inception.  There are too many flaws, and I prefer the original Avenger movie than this.  The 2012 Avengers had less characters to juggle with, better pacing, and better humor.  I wanted to like this movie, and make it a 9 out of 10 like most people.  But to me, there are so many factors that bring this movie down.  The more I watch it, the more flaws I found.  In conclusion, what disappointed me in Endgame was: Humor, life-less filter, off-screen development, and first two hours.

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future.  This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task.  While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward.  Time travel is not the easiest thing to bring to the table, and there were plenty of people that poked some holes in the scenario that was brought up in Avengers: Endgame.  Nevertheless bringing in Kang the Conqueror means that everything is on the table in regard to mixing things up on the timeline.  It also means that alternate realities are going to be in play, as well.	222.1493658039253

This poses some major implications for Spider-Man: Far From Home - it surely must be a prequel set before Avengers: Endgame, otherwise the film will have to take place in a near-miss-dystopia 2023.  It's further notable that 2020's MCU releases - Black Widow and The Eternals - are both prequels to the rest of the MCU, meaning the effects of the Infinity War don't need to be explored directly.  Time Travel's Future In The MCU After Avengers: Endgame With Hank Pym returned, there's an unlimited amount of Pym particles, meaning the Avengers are technically able to travel into the Quantum Realm as much as they so wish.

MARCO_50_2240949679-3	Iron Man, Thor, Captain America 1, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther are all great origin stories for each of the main hero where each character learns to grow and all feel different from one another with Captain America 1 taking up back to the 40s filled with great action, Doctor Strange introducing us to the multiverse and mystic arts with inspiring visuals, Black Panther taking us to Africa and telling a story about kingship, Ant-Man being a suspenseful heist movie about family, Thor being a coming of age story and taking us to a whole new world and Iron Man starting the MCU with some high stakes. All 4 Avengers movies have great characters, stories, character interactions, visuals and some of the best action in the MCU.  Iron Man 2 and 3 develop Tony’s character really well and have decent action within, WS + Civil War create a more ambitious political character driven plot with tons of heart and great team ups and action and Guardians 1 and 2 just take everything I want in a great movie and combine it all beautifully (aside from a great villain in Guardians 1 and maybe too much humor).

From the late title card to the final dance-off, the movie strongly establishes its tone and doesn't deviate for over two hours.  The fact that people actually watched this movie and came to care about a talking raccoon and a walking tree is a testament to the skills of Marvel, the director (James Gunn), the writers and actors.

Agents and many more, it can be a little hard to remember the arc of every character in the MCU universe, and even more difficult to remember the sequence of events. Hence with the Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, and Spiderman: Far From Home just around the corner, it might be a great idea to binge watches all of the movies again so that you may get a refresher of sorts.  However, it can be a little difficult to know the correct order to watch Marvel movies; after all, there are so many of them, but the release dates of the film more often than not do not match up to the chronological sequence of the events that occur in the Marvel universe.  After all, Captain America released three years after Iron Man, when it was set during the Second World War.  So, without further ado check out Marvel movies in the correct order.	203.8182506170124

Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)  The narrative is that Guardians of the Galaxy was Marvel's biggest gamble thus far, trying to sell a talking raccoon and a walking tree to general audiences.  That's true to a point, but it must be remembered that there was a point when a Norse God or World War II relic or robot suit named after a transition metal were similarly confounding to the mainstream; Marvel never had safe bets by nature of not having A-list characters.  This reading does, however, highlight Guardians of the Galaxy 's biggest strength - its swagger.  From the moment Chris Pratt starts dancing to Redbone's ""Come And Get Your Love"" as the title fills the screen, this is an incredibly confident, blended riff on Marvel superhero and Star Wars sci-fi tropes that has no interest in whether you'd heard of them before SDCC 2012 or not.

Thor is royalty at Marvel — within the pages of the comics and in the halls of Marvel editors.  And the key thing to remember is that it’s not just about the fanBOY demographic as it often was decades ago anymore.  Female readership is a force in the comic-book industry, compelling publishers to address issues of diversity.  Before the Internet explodes, let’s see how the new Thor does with the hammer — and how all readers respond to the books — before labeling this merely another publicity stunt.  2  .  A champion for diversity Marvel continues to take very seriously its stated promise to make its universe as diverse as its readership.  Whether changes involve the biracial Ultimate Spider-Man, a half Latino Nova, the Muslim Ms. Marvel or the all-female X-Men team, Axel Alonso meant it when he assumed the editorship several years ago and said the pages of Marvel Comics would reflect the real world — that no matter who you are, no matter where you’re from or what your religion or sexuality is, everyone deserves to feel like they can be a superhero.  3.

MARCO_35_1346382367-4	"Shuri’s adventures could help expand the world of Wakanda on-screen, while her attachment to T'Challa would add a compelling family dynamic. Hollywood loves family drama in movies anyway, so why not add some brother-sister angst to the Marvel milieu?  8 Gamora People would likely be surprised if Gamora, the assassin from 2014’s "" Guardians of the Galaxy ,"" got her own film, but she wouldn’t be a completely unexpected choice.  She’s already being played by Zoe Saldana of "" Avatar "" and "" Star Trek "" fame.  It’s not hard to imagine that Marvel might leverage her name recognition for a Gamora movie.  Then again, Guardians members Groot and Rocket Racoon are more popular because of their all-ages appeal, so they’d probably get kid-friendly animated films or tie-ins before Gamora would get anything of her own.  Regardless, if Saldana starred in her own Gamora movie, it would open up an interesting corner of Marvel’s cosmic universe.  A seasoned killer who is willing to take things farther than most other heroes, Gamora is a darker character than Captain Marvel, so her movie’s plot would possibly be edgier.

This trend is long overdue and one that is certain to continue in Phase 4 and beyond.  4 Female superheroes will be more prominent than ever Another area in which the MCU has been severely lacking so far is overall representation of female superheroes.  Though Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow has been a staple in the MCU since her character's introduction in Iron Man 2 (and has appeared in four films since), the only other female heroes through the first ten films were Jaime Alexander's Sif and Zoe Saldana's Gamora.

WAPO_NHSQOFLA7JB5LAS5LWDWOBWILU-1	This column discusses the plot of “Captain Marvel” in general terms.   “Captain Marvel” is the “Lean In” of superhero movies, an anodyne girl-power story that treats one woman’s journey of self-discovery as a proxy for galaxy-level change.  Though the film is precisely engineered to appeal to critics like me — feminist women who came of age in the 1990s — it’s a disappointment, from the poorly shot action sequences to a shallowly written hero’s journey.  More than anything else, “Captain Marvel” is the perfect caution that giving women and people of color top billing in major franchise movies is no guarantee that those films will say anything interesting, much less daring.  In fact, the very scale at which these franchises need to appeal to audiences and the nature of their corporate entanglements suggests that these sorts of movies may be a trap for people who are eager to see not merely new faces, but new ideas of heroism, on-screen.  Our titular heroine (Brie Larson) is first introduced in 1995 as Vers, a member of the elite — literally blue-blooded — race of Kree warriors.	253.54308989077708

It was emotionally moving.  That was big one.”  The upcoming Marvel film is a big deal for a lot of people, as it continues Black Panther's tradition of being one of the pioneering people of color to ever headline his own comic book run, and now his own film.  Not only do the Black Panther trailers suggest the film is visually stunning, its cast is full of brilliant actors of color, further ensuring that Wakanda will come off as being a believable South African country, despite being a fictional one.  Plus, with Coogler at the helm, it is safe to assume that the film will be a more accurate representation of African culture - something that a lot of movies and TV shows have botched over the years.  As for the reveal that there will be a conversation between T'Challa and his late father, T'Chaka, it will be interesting to see where this particular sequence factors in the movie.  It could be a flashback or it could also be in a vision, as Black Panther looks to delve into mysticism, as much as it will tackle science and technology.	238.6933040339627

When the film first came out in 2005, Chris Evans played the flaming superhero. Likewise, in his latest film, “Fahrenheit 451,” adapted from Ray Bradbury’s popular dystopian novel of the same name, Jordan plays the white protagonist, Guy Montag.  “I wanted to go out for those roles because it was just playing people,” Jordan said.  “It didn’t have to be the specific, ‘You’re playing the black guy in this.’” The actor also commented on the limited availability of roles written for black actors.  “You have every young black actor from the age of 17 to 40 going out for it,” he said.  “It was like, How do you reverse-engineer that problem, that kind of pitted competition between each other, and just put more opportunities out there for people to eat and be successful at what they want to do?”  The barrier Jordan is attempting to break isn’t new.  For decades, black actors have appeared in roles meant for their white counterparts.  More than 20 years ago, R&B musician Brandy Norwood danced and sang her way into people’s hearts as Cinderella.	237.5954639555457

As of this writing, we’re only down to the finalists stage, but guess what: they’re white.”  (On Tuesday, Marvel announced that Peter Parker would, in fact, be played by Tom Holland, a white actor from Britain.)  Despite an increasing number of minority supporting actors in Marvel films, the main men — and women — remain almost exclusively white, Brown said.  “Captain America?  White.  Bruce Banner?  White.  The Avengers?  White,” he wrote.  “The Guardians of the Galaxy who are played by non-white actors are painted other colors — because there can be green, grey or pink people in space, or talking trees if you like, but precious few black people, and none of them among the heroes.  …  [  T]he only place that the [  Marvel Cinematic Universe] gives us a break from all the whiteness is in secondary, supporting roles.”  Writing several months before the current controversies over the leaked e-mails and Lee’s comments, Brown was already challenging the idea that Peter Parker had to be white, or straight, or anything.	218.9466765948746
552	148_1-1	Tech salaries are all the rave now. How do I break into the tech industry?	MARCO_13_1488403286-10	If you’re interested in a tech career, pursuing an undergraduate degree, or attending a coding bootcamp is your way in. While much has been said about the former, coding bootcamp education is quickly rising as a viable path to a lucrative career.  Attending a coding bootcamp is a proven way to break into tech, especially if you have no prior experience in the industry.  Before you jump in, it’s essential to prepare for enrollment.

The UK Tech Salary Guide 2017 shows salaries for multiple tech roles and how much they have increased since last year, giving a deep insight into the roles that you should be looking into if money is your main motivation!  3) Show and prove your expertise Before attempting to break into the tech or engineering industry, potential employers need to be able to see that you’re a worthy candidate; having physical proof of your skills is much more powerful than relying on word of mouth alone.  Learn HTML, write a program or build a website - these all prove that you have the skills to work in tech; even if you’re a beginner, it still shows potential employers that you have the enthusiasm and willingness to learn.  Using social media platforms will also help build your personal profile; LinkedIn accounts not only show up at the top of Google when a name is searched, which will increase your visibility and credibility, it also lets you connect with industry professionals who may be looking to hire.	301.42819994533784

To access hidden jobs, you need to become proficient in networking, both online and off.  Google tech-based events in your area, and look for regular local meetups.  You’ll form professional relationships with people who can give you advice on how to break into the industry, find the right training for your preferred career path, or even give you a job.  Find seasoned industry professionals who are happy to provide support and encouragement to novice.  If you’re lucky, you may even find yourself a mentor.  8.  Be willing to take on an entry-level role that offers potential for advancement and training If you are working at a mid-tier or high-level role in your current job, you might have to apply for junior positions when establishing yourself in a tech field.  This will mean taking a cut in salary.  Fortunately, if you are willing to expand your skill set and choose a company that takes a proactive approach to staff development, you will be working in a senior role within a few years.

555	148_1-3	How would education have a positive impact on my tech career?	MARCO_53_638341371-3	As we know, education is about knowledge.whether you are a student or businessman or employees or whatever,you need the knowledge to do those roles well. So education provides knowledge for that, and that is the main importance of education.  Confidence Education can increase our confidence and the way we think.  Whoever you are, if you are an educated person, you can face any issue with a positive mind.  Without education, we fail in every place.  We will lose when we don’t have knowledge.  But a person with an excellent education can face anything with confidence.  Also, he will have smartest ways to look at the problems.  Becoming successful is not about minimizing your weaknesses and go on.  It is also about thinking smart and has confidence in yourself.  Enhancing the skills Education helps us to build skills like time management skills, interpersonal skills, organization skills etc.  Those obviously help us when becoming successful.  Schools create our knowledge skills, universities build our soft skills, and our experiences build our working skills.  Whatever the source is, it helps to develop our skills.  Whether you are an employee or a business owner, these skills we gained from education become an aid to your profession.  That’s a main importance of education.	238.28980982524808

MARCO_52_1009457814-3	Take Steps to Improve Your Skills and Knowledge Next, you need to take the time to invest in your own workplace education and take action to plug as many of your skills and knowledge gaps as you can. The precise steps you take here will depend on the nature of your role and the industry you work in, but it will often be sensible to invest in formal certification.  To provide an example, if you are a project manager, or otherwise work in the project management office, or PMO office for short, it may be sensible to commit to PMP certification training, as this is the most prestigious and globally recognised certification in the field.  It stands to reason, therefore, that this kind of prestigious certification will provide you with a rounded education and plug many of your knowledge gaps.  There will be similar courses or qualifications in other industries too, so take the time to carry out research and identify a training or education programme that cover the topics you identified in your skills gap analysis, or cover as wide a range of different skills as possible, so that your education is comprehensive.  3  .	202.2763597409212

Colleges and universities are expected to measure and develop students’ hard and soft skills, preparing them to compete in a knowledge-based economy.  Emphasis is placed on grades and on what will look good in a portfolio or a resume.  Lord Robbins, a British economist, stated in 1963 that universities have four objectives: instruction in skills, promotion of the general powers of the mind, advancement of learning, and transmission of a common culture and common standards of citizenship.  Clearly, learning for learnings’ sake is only part of the equation.  Perhaps, as in all aspects of life, balance is key.  Investing time in self-enlightenment is all well and good, but walking away with the skills required for an in-demand trade is not too shabby either.

This doesn’t necessarily mean becoming best friends with Kevin Lynch, the CTO of Apple (although that would be a huge bonus!), but professionals who have worked their way up in the industry, or have the job you aspire to have.

If you want to make more money If you want to work in tech and make the most money possible, you should be applying to tech giants (think Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google).  Simply put, they offer the highest compensation in the industry.  However, for many people, working at a startup will always be preferable to working at a giant corporation.  Some people prefer the high risk, high reward potential of owning equity in a startup.  Others simply can't work in a non-startup environment.  If you'd rather take a chance at being an early employee at the next Google than being employee 85,000 at a tech giant, or if you just love startups but want to maximize your income, you need to do three things: Figure out how much pure cash you can make.  This is obvious, but you want to establish that you'll be making the most cash possible via your salary and bonuses.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: ""  [  T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.  Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries.  ""While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.”"	157.27944920840673

Author Gerald Murphy Date published February 17, 2016 Categories Analytics SEO In a recent article right here on SEW, Christopher investigated the manipulation of UK political party autosuggest queries, but what exactly is search engine bias?  Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software.  Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it.  Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	150.3633845775621

Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google’s search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.  But here’s the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google’s algorithm is biased.  Let’s dive into the case study.  Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.

579	149_3-1	How do you get impartial results from search engines?	KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.  And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.   Search neutrality became a concern after search engines, most notably Google, were accused of search bias by other companies.  Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.   The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.  Sites like Amazon.com and Facebook are also accused of skewing results."	242.9026969361876

Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public.  According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be ""the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance"".  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices.  There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as ""search neutrality"" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.   In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as ""what is search neutrality?"" or ""what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?"", appear to have less consensus.

MARCO_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines). There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	157.9252248128396

DuckDuckGo – Best Alternative to Google DuckDuckGo is a very loved search engine by many of the users, especially in China.  There are many reasons.  First, this has a neat and clean interface.  And the other great thing about DuckDuckGo is that this search engine never tracks you and your activities.  Since this search engine is not actively holding on any of the personal data of its users, this means, it won’t be able to operate any search results depend on past performance.  Therefore providing you a very impartial picture of your complete search.  DuckDuckGo is another popular search engine alternative to Google and Bing.  Among the best features of DuckDuckGo, you can use it on your other browsers as an extension.  Once you install this extension, your browsing activities and the searching experience become private and secure.  In addition to this, you can use a powerful feature within this engine called bangs, where you can search another site within DuckDuckGo using a prefix.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: ""  [  T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.  Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries.  ""While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.”"	156.76786763314158
599	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_52_258700460-2	Quality bias means that the searcher will subconsciously take into account surrounding results and if they’re not relevant our behaviour can change, we may decide to retype our query or inspect a site we otherwise would not have dreamt of. This is precisely the reason why engines have quality scores for their paid search systems, if paid results are irrelevant this can mess with organic result inspection.  For the most part search algorithms are generally very effective at presenting us with relevant results so we trust the engine, this is known as trust bias.  Personalisation through cookies and the creation of 3D cubes are used to increase relevancy.  While there are many advantages of personalisation, personalisation restricts results and is a form of search engine bias.  2) Result manipulation Political and social bias came to the fore in 2002 when Google was temporarily blocked in China and since then, with the USA’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act, indexes and results have always been filtered to comply a little better with the law.  Let’s now take this the other way around, is search engine coverage biased along national lines?  In short, yes.  Engines do not have proportional coverage of a particular group of websites or regions.  But why is this?  Well, country population differences and internet penetration cause unintentional bias.	125.2049066000618

Yes there are racist people in the U.S. but not everyone is, in fact the majority of people are not.  We are one of the most racially diverse countries without a doubt.

Maybe you like Asian guys.  Maybe Latinas are more your thing.  Maybe you prefer partners who look like you.  Do these sentiments make you a racist?  The evidence is compounding, and may now be fairly conclusive, that sexual racism is a form of racism and therefore indefensible by claims of “preference.”  While some people invariably have racially defined predispositions and tendencies, it seems self-evident that discriminating against certain races in romantic or sexual circumstances is actually categorically racist.  A recent study of gay and bisexual men in Australia found that racially discriminatory dating beliefs were inextricably connected to higher levels of racial bigotry in general.  Titled “Is Sexual Racism Really Racism?” and published in Archives of Sexual Behavior, the study compared responses to questions about race and dating with a parallel questionnaire about general racial tolerance.  There was an undeniable correlation linking those respondents who were discriminatory in their dating preferences to more obvious forms of racial bigotry.	200.62500780339175

Google has been offering “Google Suggest” or “ Autocomplete ” on the Google web site since 2008 (and as an experimental feature back since 2004 ).

605	149_2-3	But how are search engines racist?	MARCO_37_196841877-15	Google Suggest To be clear, Google Suggest isn’t a standalone keyword research tool. In fact, it’s one of the search engine’s basic functions.  Whenever you enter a phrase into Google’s search bar, suggestions will appear as you type.  For example, when I type, “sewing machine,” I see the following suggestions: Then, once I complete my search, I’ll see additional suggestions at the bottom of the results page.  These suggestions are designed to help users find what they’re looking for more effectively.  But because they’re created based on user search data, they’re also extremely valuable for keyword research.  Each of these suggestions appears because they’re often searched by Google’s users.  The list is algorithmically generated as a result of other popular and productive searches.  This means that many of the suggestions you see in these spots deserve consideration in your keyword planning phase.  Of course, since this feature isn’t designed with SEOs in mind, it doesn’t offer the easy export options that other keyword planning tools have.  But you can still easily integrate it into your research process.  Search for the main keywords you’re considering targeting.  Then, scroll down to the bottom of the results page and copy and related searches that could be relevant.	196.13657523924485
606	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly. The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found.  These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color.  For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests.  One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence.  Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms.  But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology.  Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people.  Take cannabis arrests, for just one example.  Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	166.83709405735135

These algorithms can then have negative biases against women of color and other marginalized populations, while also affecting Internet users in general by leading to ""racial and gender profiling, misrepresentation, and even economic redlining.""  The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.  Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender.  Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles.  Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.  Many new technological systems promote themselves as progressive and unbiased, Noble is arguing against this point and saying that many technologies, including google's algorithm ""reflect and reproduce existing inequities.""

Johnson reports. The findings highlight the ubiquity of racial biases in the algorithms that help shape even the most critical areas of our lives.  While the study focused on just one tool from a company called Optum, bias probably exists in tools across the private and public sectors that help manage the health care of more than 200 million Americans, researchers reported in the journal Science.  “It’s truly inconceivable to me that anyone else’s algorithm doesn’t suffer from this,” said Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of computation and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who oversaw the research.  “I’m hopeful that this causes the entire industry to say, ‘Oh, my, we’ve got to fix this.’ ”  Optum is working on a fix that could more than double the number of black patients the algorithm can identify, but it’s hard to say how many algorithms for medical care have similar issues since their inner workings are often shielded from researchers.  Some lawmakers have even introduced legislation to force companies to take accountability for such biases — intentional or not.	112.69874050607903

MARCO_27_640659148-5	"They don’t have time to look through them all, so they use ATS software to do the initial sorting. This means you have to know how these algorithim-based systems work and how to get your high school resume past the digital filter.  They are designed to eliminate “unsuitable” resumes before they ever get seen by a hiring manager.  Whether an applicant's resume is perceived as a good fit is initially determined by a ""bot,"" not a person.  Employers programs the software to screen for certain skills and attributes reflected in keywords and phrases.  The ATS scans resumes on that basis, then, scores and ranks them based on how many keywords and phrases appear (as well as other factors).  Your resume will only make the cut if it is in the top ranking range.  That means it is vital for you to use those keywords in your high school resume.  Also pay special attention to formal requirements indicated in the job listing such as city, contact information, age, etc.  Now you may be wondering, how do I fit those skill keywords in with no experience?

The use of Applicant Tracking Systems has increased dramatically in the last few years: as shown in the image above, over 95% of large companies and over 50% of mid-sized companies use an ATS.  So what does the ATS look for in your resume?  The ATS algorithm scans for keywords that are related to the advertised job.  It also scans for information related to your work experience and education.  If the ATS determines that your resume is a good match for the position, it gives you a high ranking.  This ranking improves your chances of being seen by a recruiter and ultimately landing the interview.  Here is a popular ATS resume analyzer called Taleo, which demonstrates how an employer sees candidates for a particular job opening: As you can see, the ATS judges the candidates to the best-matched position and are given a higher ranking.  Why is it so important to optimize your resume for an ATS?  Your resume is up against a lot, so optimizing your resume for ATS scans will give you the best chance of getting noticed by an employer.  Let’s take a look at some numbers.  Here are some statistics that show what your resume is up against when you apply for a job.  (Source: Inc.com)	186.72286509210244

Subsequently, it will scan for specific keywords and phrases.  Where do these keywords come from?  Yep, you guessed it right.  The job description.  Like we earlier stated, almost all the words in a JD can be construed as keywords that can be used by an HR to screen and shortlist candidates.  The ATS will break down your resume into individual categories: Education, Contact Information, Skills and Work Experience.  The desired skills and keywords are then matched against your resume to determine your potential value to the organization.  Resumes with the highest scores relevant to the specified keywords/phrases will be moved up for further review.  Now you know how it broadly works.  But how to trick the ATS into ranking you higher than everybody else?  The answer to that can range from tiny pointers to a comprehensive breakdown of your resume in accordance with ATS requirements.  Do away with the headers.  Make sure even the contact information is not in the header/footer.  Mirror wording from the actual job description.	175.41860405297484

So yes, I don’t think highly of “idealism” nor romanticism.  To me, these are personal flaws.  And now let me share with you a dirty little secret: We’re all idealistic to some degree, myself included.  We all have our very own personal ideology, so to speak.  It’s a very human quality and a very insidious aspect of our psyche.  So the best way to act if you want to avoid ideologies hurting you is to stop buying into your own narratives.  Always question your own ideas and motives.  Avoid identifying with them.  Don’t surrender to group pressure.  Always ask yourself if you’re the good guy.
