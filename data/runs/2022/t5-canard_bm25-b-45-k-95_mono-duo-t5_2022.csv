Johnson is also expected to focus on climate change, a top priority for the United Kingdom ahead of the COP26 conference it is due to host in November 2021. UK Secretary for Business Kwasi Kwarteng has indicated that Johnson will be seeking coordinate action on carbon border taxes, green finance, the phase-out of coal and helping poorer countries to set up climate change. While the taxes have been backed by the EU and US, EU climate ambassador Mark Vanhuekelen indicated that Australia may oppose the measures. Another expected topic of discussion is international co-ordination on economic policies. United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has signaled a revival in American multilateralism, focusing on the need for continued economic support.	395.5433440501563

WAPO_7X7AWMCHIQI6VENLZZBZVJOHYE-0	"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson began a ""year of climate action"" on Tuesday, hours after the former president of the U.N. climate conference said the British leader doesn't ""get"" climate change. The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit. Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday. Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.” Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050."	392.2251936461746

WAPO_RG7DHDRJR4I6XHBBHTCQDUEYD4-0	"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasn't talked much about climate change since he declared in February that 2020 would be a ""year of climate action. "" The global pandemic and economic crisis eclipsed climate on his agenda. But he pivoted back to the topic Wednesday, announcing a ""green industrial revolution"" he said would address both climate and pandemic-related concerns — helping the country to become emissions-neutral while creating a quarter-million jobs and reviving the battered economy. Among the notable elements of his 10-point plan is a ban on new sales of gas and diesel cars to start in 2030. That's five years earlier than Johnson said in February and 10 years earlier than the plan before that. “The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand,” he said in a statement. Johnson, head of the right-of-center Conservative Party, wants to highlight Britain’s global leadership role before it is due to host COP26, a major international climate summit, next November."	331.3148226275971

There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to human activities.Section::::Content issues.Some observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science.	172.2052791165188

9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that.Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage. And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor. Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires. Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .” Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death. Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks. As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	254.89937796624145

MARCO_msmarco_doc_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts.Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health. Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	132.82107282988727

Those most vulnerable to climate related health effects - such as children, the elderly, the poor, and future generations - face disproportionate risks.	128.8615506887436

KILT_24224089-24	"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment report from 2007, Argentina will be impacted by climate change with differing affects depending on the region of Argentina in question. A declining trend in precipitation may be observed in south-west Argentina while expected increases in sea-level rise (SLR), extreme weather and climatic variability are very likely to affect coastal areas of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Stress on water availability and quality has been documented where lower precipitation and/or higher temperatures occur. For example, droughts related to La Niña create severe restrictions for water supply and irrigation demands in central western Argentina. Additionally, glaciers in Latin America have receded dramatically in the past decades, and many of them have disappeared completely. IPCC predicts this trend to continue and perhaps even worsen. The most affected sub-regions are the Peruvian Andes, southern Chile and Argentina up to latitude 25°S.

It was the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.The conference negotiated the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change, the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 parties attending it. The agreement enters into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries signed the agreement in New York,According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks, the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2 °C"" Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels."	145.629425695166
26	132_2-9	That’s not too relevant to my question. By the way, is the Paris Agreement related to COP26 in Glasgow?	WAPO_MFJTN65BNZCQTCCG5CUTO6SJOM-0	The latest round of global climate negotiations just concluded in the coal city of Katowice, Poland. This was the 24th meeting of the “conference of the parties” (COP) to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change — and the most important meeting since COP 21, the 2015 Paris agreement.   What was at stake? This year’s negotiations were about finalizing the “Paris rule book” — and they somewhat miraculously did, with an accord on the rules finally reached Saturday. The Paris agreement ushered in a different approach to reducing greenhouse gases, after previous false starts. Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve. Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.	142.01551626319997

As uncertainty loomed Wednesday about the future of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, the rest of the world was left to react to the country’s official departure from the Paris accord — a move that Trump had been promising since he took office, saying he considered it an unfair deal for the country. A joint statement from the leaders of Chile, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United Nations expressed “regret” at the U.S. withdrawal. But they insisted that the world would carry on regardless. “We remain committed to working with all U.S. stakeholders and partners around the world to accelerate climate action, and with all signatories to ensure the full implementation of the Paris agreement,” the group wrote, adding, “There is no greater responsibility than protecting our planet and people from the threat of climate change.	120.94984847679734

Biden is the oldest person ever elected to the White House. He served as the 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Before becoming the Vice President, he had represented Delaware as a United States Senator from 1973 to 2009. Born in a middle-class family in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden learned the value of hard word, determination and perseverance from his parents who always encouraged him to stand up for himself and bounce back after failures. As a child he used to stammer but he overcame this problem by memorizing and reciting long passages in front of the mirror. He went on to study law and also developed interest in politics. He joined the Democratic Party and became active in politics alongside managing his legal career. He won the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware when he was just 29 and assumed office the next year. A devastating family tragedy threatened to end his career, but he persevered on bravely. He proved to be a popular senator and set his ambitions higher. He was selected as the running-mate for presidential nominee Barack Obama in 2008 and the Obama-Biden ticket went on to win the election. They won again in 2012.	178.35242376785027

WAPO_ZLELEVX3HRGD5J427C6GSFMCVA-0	President-elect Joe Biden, during a conversation with a small group of journalists on Wednesday, conceded that he is entering office not with a black box, but with “black corners in the box.” This was a concession that the transition has been incomplete and frustrating to a large degree. This has not been the case across the entire current administration, Biden explained, but in a number of areas, “the professionals are at a loss” to explain where things stand. Chaos and lack of clarity are hobbling the current administration and are making the transition particularly difficult. “I can’t tell if I have a clear view of where the landmines are,” Biden confessed. In a noteworthy revelation, the president-elect said he has consulted Republican appointees who are no longer in office to try to get a handle on what is going on.

WAPO_BE2M3KWIBRDTBAKILLO25Z6OAM-4	China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases. “The U.S. role here is somewhat schizophrenic — pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,” said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit based in Virginia. “Over the long haul, making the agreement operational will do more to strengthen climate ambition than any immediate political signals.” In a statement, the U.S. State Department said that while the administration’s position on the Paris agreement — the U.S. is leaving — remains unchanged, the latest meeting helped the U.S. with “holding our economic competitors accountable” when it comes to adequately reporting their greenhouse gas emissions. “The United States is not taking on any burdens or financial pledges in support of the Paris Agreement and will not allow climate agreements to be used as a vehicle to redistribute wealth,” the statement said.	126.23109050479252
37	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_da552161e78f2c80204622838bdaaed2-2	The United States sets its own targets, in pledges made to the United Nations, and like every other country, it is supposed to increase them over time. Thus, in the end, the United States does as much as it can or wants to under Paris. In fairness, the agreement certainly does assume that all countries are earnestly committed to cutting emissions. The current U.S. pledge, to reduce emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, is fairly ambitious, and without such a pledge by the world’s second largest emitter, the Paris agreement would have been harder to reach. Equally surprising is Trump’s assertion that China “doesn’t adhere” to the Paris agreement. China’s commitments, too, are self-generated under the agreement, but no less significant for that reason.  Getting on the same page with the world’s top emitter, as President Obama did in late 2014, was key to setting the world on the road to achieving Paris.	125.97544954065232

Waddell DVM, DACVECC, in Small Animal Critical Care Medicine, 2009 INTRODUCTION Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) is the physiochemical phenomenon that occurs when two solutions with different colloid concentrations are separated by a semipermeable membrane.The particles contributing to COP (and the particles that they may hold with them because of their electrical charge) do not pass readily through the semipermeable membrane. This is in contrast to most crystalloid particles such as electrolytes, glucose, and other metabolites, which pass readily through the membrane. COP is determined with a patient's blood sample in reference to normal saline rather than pure water because normal saline is more representative of the fluid in the interstitial space. COP should be thought of as the osmotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins and their associated electrolytes, because the electrolytes contribute significantly to the COP. Albumin and its associated cations provide approximately 60% to 70% of the plasma oncotic pressure and globulins provide the remaining 30% to 40%. Oncotic pressure is defined as the osmotic pressure exerted by colloids in solution, so the terms COP and oncotic pressure can be used interchangeably; colloid oncotic pressure, a commonly used misnomer, is redundant.	303.2958441037431

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own. Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients. Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though! To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well. Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture. Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover. The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	288.1386301194225

If you want to learn how to make your own DIY face makeup remover, there are step-by-step instructions below! I have tried a lot of homemade makeup removers. My go-to is generally the Oil Cleansing Method, but sometimes I am admittedly lazy, and want to be able to remove my makeup while watching tv on the couch. You feel me, right? I find that makeup remover wipes are highly convenient for such times, and will occasionally find myself buying them at the store. But there are two things that bother me when buying makeup remover wipes: they’re expensive, and they contain unnecessary chemicals that dry out my facial skin. (Not trying to call out any specific companies here, but one “ultra-calming” makeup remover I’ve tried contains isononyl isononanoate, pentaerythrityl tetraethylhexanoate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, and 20 more ingredients. In a makeup remover. It’s crazy!) A few years ago, it occurred to me that I could make my own homemade makeup remover wipes!	250.1198639838567

MARCO_msmarco_doc_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor.It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks. STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48. Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7. Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10. Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22. Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes. These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48. Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection. Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	326.9545469906552

Everything from the source of the fragrance, the odor prevention, to the lack of aluminum ensures there is nothing unnatural in their products that could be cause for concern. No White Stains One of the main attributes for any reputable deodorant is that it should not cause white stains and this is something that Schmidt’s can boast. Because aluminum is one of the main culprits for this annoyance, and there is none to be found in their products, anyone using them for the first time should not have to worry about white stains. What Is The Best Schmidt’s Deodorant? This depends on the person’s needs as anyone with sensitive skin will find their dedicated range to be preferable. Otherwise, we are a big fan of the Charcoal + Magnesium deodorant. It is a product that has a natural scent making it fone for both men and women, made from essential oils, and uses no aluminum salts or artificial fragrance.

In our house we buy each child a new ornament every year and of course it all starts with the first one! The idea is to gift them all the ornaments when they move to their own home so that they have a bunch of ornaments to get started. I copied this tradition from a friend’s mom and I just love the idea of having ornaments that tell a story. Each ornament can represent something the child was into that year or special event that year. Baby’s first Christmas ornament can be simple and homemade or a pure silver spoon – it’s entirely up to you!

MARCO_msmarco_doc_38_286385654-3	I used this basic homemade body scrub recipe to make to following awesome scrubs: Warm Vanilla Sugar Body Scrub Use vanilla essential oil -OR- 2 Tbsp. vanilla extract.Lemon Salt Body Scrub Use lemon essential oil and add 1 Tbsp of lemon zest. Grapefruit Mint Salt Scrub Use grapefruit essential oil and 1 Tbsp of grapefruit zest.

Tips and Ideas for A Great Scrub The yummy concoctions you can create are limitless. Note: Olive oil is not the best carrier oil for some homemade body scrub formulas because it has a strong fragrance. If you think olive oil will be overpowering in a delicately scented body scrub, choose one of the other carrier oils. I also love being able to use different sugars or Epsom salts – mainly because I had a huge bag of Epsom salts under the bathroom sink that was not getting used. (My organic cane sugar is not cheap!) Choose sugar for fine grain homemade body scrub, and Epsom salts for a larger grain scrub. The oil will separate in some of these scrubs, so it’s a good idea to attach a small spoon if giving away as a gift.	135.47275906491268

69	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_15_1872813287-3	So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils.Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin. So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion. But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion. Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils. Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well. So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc. Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.	127.60145561034368
70	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_105794544-8	You can use a single essential oil or a combination of several—it's completely customizable.If you aren’t sure what scents you like, you might try: Lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent Rose oil for a classic floral fragrance Citrus oils like sweet orange and grapefruit for a bright, energetic scent Patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent Myrrh, frankincense, or benzoin for a dramatic, resinous scent Tip: Always use high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oil for your lotion. Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin. 2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil. At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance. If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again. However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil. Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted. 3 Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color. These products are oil-soluble, so they're perfect for this recipe.	123.19663495469284
71	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_24_1169299216-5	The type of essential oils you use will depend on the purpose of the lotion: Peppermint and ginger for cooling massage lotions after exercise.Calendula and chamomile for sensitive skin. Argan oil and patchouli for anti-aging face creams. Aqueous vs. Oil Lotions The main difference between a lotion and body butter is how much water is in it. With most creams, more than half of the tub is water. When you’re making home-made lotions, the problem with water is that it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. This means that to keep the lotion fresh, you need to add some sort of preservative. Some essential oils, such as tea tree, make good preservatives, so if you are planning on adding those to your blend, then that may be enough to preserve a small tub of lotion. If you don’t want to add preservatives, though, you’re going to struggle. Body butter is less likely to go rancid quickly, but a lot of people don’t like them because of the texture. Water-based oils are a good choice for those people, and there are some active ingredients such as rose water, aloe juice, and witch hazel that are water soluble and work well in water-based lotions.	121.80404580725644
72	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1188224872-5	Equipment Measuring cups and spoons Medium mixing bowl Hand mixer 8-ounce jar or container A hand mixer is the easiest way to combine the ingredients, but it can be manually stirred as well.Step-by-Step Instructions Put the shea/cocoa butter into a bowl and mix it alone until it’s soft. Add the hemp seed oil in small amounts, mixing in between. Add the cornstarch or arrowroot powder and the other oils. Mix the lotion until it is to the desired texture. Notes If your hemp lotion comes out too thick for your liking, add a little more hemp seed oil and a few more drops of your secondary oil. Adding more essential oil may make the scent too strong. If you used unrefined hemp seed oil, make sure to keep the hemp lotion somewhere out of the sunlight, as that will shorten its shelf life. You can also make a thicker hemp lotion, like body butter, from this same formula minus the cornstarch/arrowroot powder. Start by melting 3 tablespoons of beeswax then adding the shea/cocoa butter and mixing. Then add the oils and stir. Pour this into a container and let it set.	118.80666910973378
73	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_12_1463786556-21	Melt the mixture and stir in order to blend all the ingredients together.Remove the bowl from the heater water and allow the mixture to cool to body temperature. In order to keep the texture smooth, stir the mixture from time to time. When the concoction has cooled down, bring 8 ounces of distilled water to body temperature and place it inside a blender. Gently add a thin stream of oil into the water, with the blender turned on a low setting. A few minutes in, you should notice that the mixture gains a creamy texture, which will get smoother the more you mix it. Those of you that plan to add essential oils to the recipe, pour in just a few drops, so that you can gradually increase the fragrance up to a point where it feels enough for you.

75	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone.Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing? Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs? Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer. Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device? If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone. Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out. This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying. Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance. What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs? It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting. Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	217.06904818021576

Choose a brand: At present, there are many kinds of domestic and foreign mobile phone brands on the market, consumers should mainly consider the reputation of the brand mobile phone manufacturers, after-sales service, mobile phone quality and related accessories are easy to buy.3 . Compare the function, select the appearance, and look at the demand point: It is not that the more functions the better, many functions may not be used by themselves, so it is necessary to measure their own needs and make comparisons. Know if you have a passion for a particular brand / system? Or do you need to take a clearer picture? Or is it more smooth to play games without fever? Or do you need the latest 5G phone? Or do you need to be waterproof and anti-falling? Or a big battery? Know what your needs are and sort them in order of importance. 4. Look at the configuration: To buy a mobile phone, you need to pay attention to CPU type, memory capacity, memory, screen size, camera, battery capacity, etc., and choose the highest configuration for the demand point you are most concerned about at the same price.	137.4997302917909
77	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_69096130-9	Other tips and tricks you should know There are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when buying a new phone.First of all, don’t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you’re used to. Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi. Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn’t mean it makes bad phones. As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews. And don’t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it’s without faults. For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard. Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money. Also, don’t just go for the latest phones out there. Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model. A lot of the time the latest versions of phones are only minor upgrades over their predecessors but cost a lot more.	130.58609408672783

Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular. Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone. Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones. If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display. Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers. Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them. Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan. After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward. Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose. The least you can pay for the plan is $15 plus an additional $5 for data and unlimited minutes.	210.12107357593777

Here are 10 tips to help you with your next purchase. 1. Form Follows Function You want to be sure you are purchasing a phone that will deliver all the features and capabilities you want and need. Rather than think in terms of what you used your last phone for, think instead of what you would like your next phone to be able to do! If email is important to you, that instantly presents WinMo phones and BlackBerries as options. If texting is your thing, then a spacious, comfortable keypad is critical. 2. Get the Best Deal you Can There are more options for purchasing phones today than ever. Changes in carrier policies and new regulations allow customers to, say, purchase a phone on the internet and bring it to a carrier to have it activated. Some carriers, like Verizon, set up kiosks at local events and add special offers on top of your 2-year renewal discount.	185.3219872699483

Marcus suggests that they're thinking it over. In Sheridan's quarters, Garibaldi shows him the recording of Mr. Morden's conversation with Clark. Sheridan decides to get the recording to General Hague. Garibaldi expresses the concern that they might be accused of faking it, but Sheridan tells him that the message will contain the proper ID code to tie the message undeniably to Clark. Aboard the White Star, the mask reappears and utters a single word – Zog – then disappears. As the First Ones move away, Ivanova realizes they have denied the request for help. She refuses to let them leave without saying yes. Facetiously, Marcus suggests he put a bucket on his head and pretend to be the ancient Vorlon god Booji, which gives Ivanova an idea. She calls the First Ones back and thanks them for trying but she was warned by the Vorlons that they'd give up without trying. She tells them that the Vorlons claimed that they carried the other First Ones in the last war. Impressed by her audacity, the mask returns to inform them in English that when the time is right, she need only call their name and they will come.	252.1854221837348

MARCO_msmarco_doc_22_1749042451-6	Motorola Moto G7 Power If you want something more affordable, cheaper, but has the latest in Android and that comes with 5000mAh of battery, then the Motorola Moto G7 Power is an excellent phone to consider.With an ANSI rating of M4/T3, not only that you’ll get the latest in Android, but you’ll also get a phone that has better HAC ratings than Google’s flagship phone and all of that for less than USD$300 SRP. So if you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t break the bank, something of the latest but not necessarily the best, then we highly recommend considering the Moto G7 Power. 5. Samsung Galaxy A10e If you want an Android smartphone that’s cheaper, more affordable, and you still find the Moto G7 Power a bit off your budget, then we highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy A10e. This phone has an ANSI rating of M3/T3 with an SRP of USD $179.99. In some countries, it is being sold for under 100 which is by far the cheapest Samsung phone with the latest Android OS to date. So if you’re someone who’s new to the smartphone, or planning to gift this device to your parents or elderly relatives, then the Galaxy A10e is a great option to consider.	404.6929015288224

MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_97721069-6	Poor camera performance is to be expected with phones in this price range, but last year's Moto G7 phones could usually provide sharper photos in our testing.Should you buy it? Samsung Galaxy A10e 7.5 / 10 Maybe. I definitely enjoyed using the Galaxy A10e, thanks to its smaller physical size, great battery life, and lightweight design. The software experience is very close to what you'd get on Samsung's $1,000+ flagship smartphones, and performance was acceptable. It also works on all major US carriers, which is missing from Nokia's budget phones. However, the lack of NFC support and a fingerprint sensor might be deal-breakers for some people. As previously mentioned, Motorola is now selling phones for less money than the Galaxy A10e that have fingerprint sensors and full support for all US carriers — though you still won't get NFC for contactless payments. The Galaxy A10e also has an extremely poor camera, but you won't get anything significantly better from the competition at this price range. Buy it if: You want a Galaxy phone, but your budget is around $200. Your priorities are hardware/software performance and battery life. Don't buy it if: You take a lot of photos. You need NFC support or a fingerprint scanner.	368.5544886290745

You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10. Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app). And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers. We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.

The excellent processor combined with the nice screen and other features make this a phone that will be a popular option to upgrade to from older devices. Moto G7 Optimo (Play) VS Moto G7 Optimo MAXX (Power) Tracfone released both these phones for use on their network and they share some of the same features while also having a few key differences. Let's quickly break that down for you. The G7 Optimo MAXX has a larger screen (6.2"" vs 5.7""), 1 GB more RAM, larger battery (5,000 mAh vs 3,000) and slightly better camera. The Optimo and Optimo MAXX have the same processor, storage and Android OS. They are also both available for about the same price from Tracfone. For users who don't mind the larger form factor and screen, the Optimo MAXX is the clear choice. But some users may prefer the smaller G7 Optimo, and it still makes for a great option."	103.71248856559396

For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back. Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone. The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker. The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display. Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall. The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	427.6402694421136
94	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen.Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant. Blacks are much darker and inkier as well. When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too. That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles. One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent. You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes. Samsung did not add water protection to the A50. The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent. Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video? Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting. And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	404.5984941600557

The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7. I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.

The most important aspects of life for me are health and family, so I focus on getting those managed well because when that is done, everything else naturally falls into place. You have to decide what aspects of life and business are most important to you, get them running smoothly and allow your forward movement to fall into place. 5. Approach every day as a school day. When I coach entrepreneurs, I tell them, ""Fail forward and fail fast, and every day will be a school day.""

Evaluating your run and making plans for future runs will grow your excitement to get out again tomorrow. The simple act of crossing off each day on a calendar after you complete your 3 miles is shown to build the habit and make it more likely you’ll stick to your routine. 5. Invite a Friend If you’re worried about the quality friend time you’ll have to shave out of your schedule, invite a friend to join your journey.	199.06918662141837

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_1127579161-55	"What I Talk about When I Talk about Running Writing Haruki Murakami started running about the same time he started writing novels (at age 33).He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"". Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin. Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being. ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void... ""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [ clouds]. What I should be looking at is inside me."	191.4976739028225

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_951513314-15	Whether you need to carry your iPhone when running to map the terrain, listen to music, or attend phone calls on the go, you can’t carry it in your hand.One slip and the glass sandwich will break from both sides, or the distraction could make things worse and lead to an accident. The most common option would be carrying the iPhone in the pocket of your shorts, but the constant bounce can kill your rhythm, even it does just jump out of the pocket during the run. Unless you’re wearing a running vest or a sports bra that comes with a slip pouch to place your device, your best bet is to get a running armband for iPhone. Available in different materials and designs such as armbands, wristbands, and even waistbands for greater comfort, you can pick your favorite iPhone holder for running the easy way. Is the best iPhone running armband safe to use? We seldom get out of the house without our smartphones, so it seems obvious that you’d want to take your iPhone when you’re out on your daily jog.

A phone is one accessory that most of us want to take with us on the run. Whether you want to: listen to music or podcasts, use a fitness tracking app, snap pictures, make a call, or be ready for an emergency, there are plenty of purposes to carry your smartphone. You can go out for a run without your phone. However, there are excellent reasons to have a phone with you while you run: Safety: It’s a good idea to have a phone in your hands in case something goes wrong. Fitness apps: Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Nike+, and others can keep that data you want from your workouts – and even help you find your way should you get lost.

What is the best iPhone holder type to get? Generally speaking, there are essentially three different types of smartphone holders for running that you get in the market today. The first and most commonly used one is the armband design, which allows you to strap up the iPhone to either of your arms while offering a little view of the screen. The second design is the wrist band holder for running, which offers better access to the iPhone screen, but might affect the quality of long runs. Lastly, the option to pick the best iPhone waistband for running is a good one too, where you get no access to the iPhone screen for music controls or call answering, but provides more stability during the run, and additional storage space to place your keys and wallet along with it. Final Words Depending on your running style, you might not be entirely comfortable with even the best iPhone armband in the market.	200.79369619376664

Last updated on March 31, 2019 Last Updated on May 2, 2019 by Husain Parvez The two most popular smartphones are the iPhone and Android phones. They are developed by different companies and also have unique features. Smartphone buyers are often torn between these types. The choice of which one to pick depends largely on the specifications and capabilities which you are searching for. While there were a number of other smartphone alternatives such as Windows Phone and Blackberry, they have since gone obsolete. Therefore, majority of smartphones today are either iPhones or Android phones. IPhone vs. Android: What Should You Get? Here are some characteristics that can guide your choice as you pick the right one. Apple vs Android – Easy To Use If you’re searching for a smartphone that is easy to use, the iPhone is a better pick. This smartphone has a simple interface that is easy to learn, use and maintain. It provides you with a home-screen which contains a collection of icons. You can also personalize it with a photo. Thus, it is uncluttered and easy to utilize. iPhone or Android – Maximum Control Sometimes you may want to have extra control over your smartphone.	164.36450166394934

Apple makes a bunch of phones now, so you do have plenty of options across a range of price points – the iPhone SE 2020 is the cheapest, however. With Android, you have potentially thousands of options from loads of different phone companies – from Samsung to OPPO and smaller nice brands like TCL and RealMe. Android phones come in all shapes and sizes, so you do have more choice, and each Android phone maker does things a little differently too – so no two Android phones are exactly the same. Save With Android, you’re reliant on Google services, things like Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, and with iPhone, you use Apple’s services – iCloud, Mail, iMessage, and the App Store. In terms of internal specs and components, iPhones and Android phones are similar – they all have modems, 5G/4G chipsets, internal storage, advanced camera units, and all the other things that make smartphones actually smart. There are some distinct differences between iPhone and Android phones, though, and the most noticeable one is that Android phones tend to be more customizable.	142.37813900364563

Author: Lindsay Ingram Publish date: Nov 28, 2014 1:18 PM EST Here are 10 Android phones that are better than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- iPhone users almost have it easy when choosing a new phone, currently the best options are the big iPhone 6, or the bigger iPhone 6 Plus. Choosing an Android phone can be a bit harder since there are so many options available. With that wide selection comes more competition, though, and there's an argument to be made that some of the phones are even better than the iPhone, no matter which iPhone you're talking about. What makes an Android phone better than an iPhone is all based on what you value in a phone. Maybe you want a more durable, waterproof phone, or a phone with a different design and more color options. Maybe you really, really want a stylus and a huge display. Or it could be as simple as you prefer to be locked into Google's ecosystem instead of Apple's because hey, no one company's products are right for everyone.	135.7689858667436

It was first introduced as a smartphone platform in 2008 but has since been integrated into computers, tablets and a wealth of mobile devices. It would be impractical to list every Android phone in existence, not only due to the huge array of varieties but also because virtually any phone can be an Android phone.

Who said too many choices is a good thing. Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision. A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me. IPhone did that. People don’t grow fans out of thin air. There has to be stuff backing it. Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years. Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized. So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones. Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_930919582-8	These platforms also eclipsed the popularity of smartphone platforms historically aimed towards enterprise markets, such as BlackBerry.There has been an industry shift from feature phones (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume sales, to high-end flagship smartphones, which also enjoy higher margins, thus manufacturers find high-end smartphones much more lucrative than feature phones. The shift away from feature phones has forced mobile network operators to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling-prices of flagship smartphones have had a negative effect on the mobile network operators, who have seen their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer feature phones. To help make up for this, carriers typically use high-end devices to upsell customers onto higher-priced service plans with increased data allotments. Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that include newer features and technology, and that smartphones were considered to be more relevant in present-day popular culture than feature phones.	223.02432253684677

MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity.Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury. 1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again. They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run. Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis. And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance. As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first. Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly. For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace. These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport. You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	299.8115922475372

MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_1113525875-4	Walk The fastest way to get back into running is to slow it down.Even if that means taking regular walk breaks or signing up for a couch-to-5K walk/run training program, says Hamilton. In fact, she tells all of her clients who have taken several months off of running to spend the first couple of weeks focusing on walking, not running. (Try pairing your strength workouts with walking a few miles several times a week to get some miles under your feet.) Because here’s the cold, hard truth: “If you don't have a long history of running behind you, you may need to start over at the beginning with your training,” she says.

119	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_964601708-3	Here's what to do during your break.Make it last. Take at least one three- or four-week break each year. Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training. Time it right. The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes. Stay in shape. During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times. For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started). Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do. For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout. The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity. In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness. You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.	243.7396857593485

MARCO_msmarco_doc_52_483672706-4	Any kind of strength training.Cool Down For Running After running, a good cool down can be a brisk walk for 2-3 minutes, gradually tapering your pace or stroll. Sprinting is the same concept, but start with jogging, then taper down to walking. This will be followed by static stretches that aim to increase the range of motion and flexibility of your lower body. Start with standing stretches, then seated stretches. As you can see, it’s a gradual pace to bring your body down to normal levels and relaxation. Cool Down for Resistance & Strength Training After resistance training, you will want to do a mobility cool down routine. This involves gentle bodyweight movements and stretching. It’s like a yoga flow, where you move in an out of movements, holding stretches for 5-10 seconds (although you can hold stretches longer if you want, as after a workout it is fine). We have an example of this kind of routine further below (see 4-Min Cool Down Routine). Note: Make sure you emphasize stretches for areas you worked most in your workout. So, if it was an upper body day, focus on your upper body more. If it was a full body day, you can do an evenly targeted full body cool down.	142.0208648070693

Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength. What is a confused body to do?! As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training). It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances. While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time. The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.

For example, our 130-pound woman would burn about 2,600 calories running a four-hour marathon. Conversely, if she biked a six-hour century (100 miles), she would burn 4,250 calories--an extra 1,650 calories--for a similar effort. Tips to Burn More Calories Polka Dot Images/Polka Dot/Getty Images The best thing you can do to burn more calories over time is to ride often. You burn calories faster if you ride hard. You can't ride hard every day, but schedule a few rides a week where you pick up the pace by pushing a harder gear, spinning at a higher cadence or riding uphill until you're sucking wind.

KILT_179821-3	Some ski resorts offer lodging options on the slopes themselves, with ski-in and ski-out access allowing guests to ski right up to the door. Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski () is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts. These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding. The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.	191.0739512129221

MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_576504017-2	Jump rope is notoriously popular among boxers, but might as well be among swimmers too.Jumping rope is a simple dryland cardio workout which is great for improving foot speed, agility, coordination, and shoulder strength, all while burning a ton of calories. Another huge bonus of this dryland cardio workout is the fact that it’s straightforward, cheap, and easily accessible. You don’t need a lot of space to jump rope and it can be done practically anywhere. Personally, I like to do some jump rope before getting in the water to help warm up and activate my muscles. Something as simple as 5 minutes of jumping rope is a great way to warm up the body and ensure that you don’t get injured in the pool. An additional benefit of jumping rope is the fact that this is very low impact on the body, similar to swimming. Jumping rope doesn’t place a lot of stress on the joints and is easy to recover from after a workout. If you want to incorporate this into your training regimen as a dryland cardio workout I recommend doing interval jumping, similar to interval training in the pool. Do 1-2 minutes of continuous skipping and then rest 30 seconds.	149.81598092569038

Safety: Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height. Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits. That’s the height you’re going for. If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope. Duration and frequency: 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space. Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete. If you’re a beginner: Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet. Do this move for 15 seconds. Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope. Do this move for 15 seconds.

152	135_2-7	So what's a better alternative to running on an empty stomach?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_09_17958275-2	Is it better to run on an empty stomach?First, consider the time and effort. If you’re running less than 60 minutes at an easy pace, you may not need to eat anything—your body has enough glycogen (its preferred fuel source) stored to power you through, but you should focus on refueling properly afterward. Any run lasting longer than 60 minutes or performed at a vigorous to intense effort may require some extra fuel to keep you going. That said, everyone is different and multiple factors influence this so if you find you’re hitting the wall on most runs around mile four or 45 minutes in, then you’ll adjust your fuel plan accordingly. If you choose to eat before the run, in order to get that food in and digested, one option is to see if you can go to bed a half-hour earlier and then drag yourself out of bed thirty minutes earlier, which would give you time to digest a more substantial meal. But, I realize how precious every minute of sleep can be, and also how difficult it can be to get in bed earlier, so here are some other ideas. What should I do before running in the morning?	229.46917889083213

154	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_971491333-4	Training duration and intensity are severely restricted by the lack of glycogen.Therefore, the intended training stimulus is rather low. A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance. Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores. This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism. The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles. However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance. At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health. Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training. This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast. So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes. Choose a low intensity (at a recovery run or conversation pace). You should drink a glass of water before your run.	193.1163105983869

MARCO_msmarco_doc_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure.On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate. The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon. In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal. It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	139.63273821072653

The Watergate scandal remains one of the most notorious episodes in 20th century American history. As the scandal unfolded between July 1972 and August 1974, it revealed a pattern of corruption and illegal activity within the Nixon White House, all of which President Nixon knew of and approved. The Watergate scandal was such a transformative event in American politics that the suffix “-gate” is now attached to any political scandal. The Watergate Scandal and the Nixon Administration Members of the Nixon Administration worked with the Committee for the Re-Election of the President (CREEP) to attempt to break into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate office complex. The burglars were arrested and quickly connected to lower officials at the Nixon White House.

It was because of the scandal that Nixon was forced to resign on August 9th, 1974. The significance of the Watergate Scandal was immense. The scandal broke out because of break in that occurred in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee on June 17th 1972.

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell. At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty. G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison. Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC). Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica. In it, he claimed that high White House officials had pressured the defendants to plead guilty. The five who pleaded had perjured themselves at the urging of “higher-ups.”	138.55161762759235

Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power. Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever. The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat. The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	179.51918528409078

Congress tried to limit presidential power in an effort to ensure a similar scandal never occurs again. Further, the American people also grew weary of big government. Further, as a result of Watergate, the presidential office was weakened, allowing Soviets to expand. In addition, Watergate also led to the North Vietnamese regaining territory because the president was too busy with Watergate.

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal. The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded. Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president. Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms. But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation. 1. The Supreme Court remained supreme. It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.	246.2640365085099

On June 17, 1972, The Washington Post published a small story. In this story, the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate. These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers. The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deeply into the story. Their names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward; they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime. The reporters suspected that the break-in had been ordered by other White House officials. In a press conference in August of 1972, President Nixon said that nobody in the White House staff was involved in the crime. Most of the public accepted Nixon’s word and dropped the investigation.	125.04140883497894

Deep Throat was the legendary anonymous source for Post reporter Bob Woodward when he was reporting on President Richard Nixon in 1972 and 1973, who was made even more famous by Hal Holbrook’s portrayal of him as a shadowy underground parking-lot denizen in the movie version of Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s book, “All the President’s Men.” Woodward never publicly revealed who Deep Throat was. The secret held despite extravagant third-party investigations (former Nixon aide Leonard Garment wrote an entire book about it in 2000, “In Search of Deep Throat,” fingering the wrong guy). It wasn’t until 2005, as he neared death, that Mark Felt, a high-ranking FBI official during the Nixon years, stepped out of the metaphoric shadows and declared that he was Woodward’s source.	153.30766308490274

When five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972, Felt was the man chosen to head up the investigation. His mission was to determine the involvement, if any, of the White House. After being pressured from upstairs to stay clear, Felt decided the press was the only way to expose the corruption and the White House’s complicity. Using the moniker Deep Throat, he met regularly with Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helping them uncover the full story which ultimately lead to Nixon’s resignation. 2) Columbia HealthCare John Schilling, a reimbursement supervisor for Columbia Healthcare, together with four colleagues, brought a FCA case against their employers, as well as accountant KPMG Peat Marwick.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_719719292-1	Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation. He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation. This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence. Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	307.0851142643842

For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_719719292-1	Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation. He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation. This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence. Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	167.3920885999396

197	137_1-5	"Deep. What do other philosophers think about Bostrom's ""simulation argument""?"	MARCO_msmarco_doc_30_1549247804-2	Bostrom’s biggest argument for this belief is called the simulation argument, which he states that, if ancestor simulations are something an advanced civilization would end up creating, then most of the self aware minds that ever come into existence, are simulated ones.Another argument for this belief is the idea of the Boltzmann brain, which argues that in an infinite multiverse, it should be tremendously more common for particles to randomly assemble into a brain that is having the exact same experience as you are having right now, than for particles to create big bangs.Ancestor simulations is a belief proposed by Nick Bostrom, a professor at Oxford University, he believes that, in the future, it will be possible to simulate the actions of all the neurons in the brain and simulate the sensory input to that brain with enough accuracy to convince the simulation that it is a real person. For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds. There are many articles, videos and interviews on the topic and even people like Neil deGrasse Tyson have backed up this belief.	218.5795452466809

Although   we   are   unlikely   to   get   proof,   we   might   find   some   hints   about   our   reality.   “I   think   it   might   be   feasible   to   get   evidence   that   would   at   least   give   weak   clues,”   says   Bostrom.

Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world. If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.

201	137_1-9	Okay, so what do glitches in the simulation prove about our existence in it?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_715074680-1	What is the Multiverse Theory? - Universe Today Posted on November 5, 2010 July 21, 2020 by Matt Williams What is the Multiverse Theory? If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes. The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically. Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy. In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James. However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	233.33603569460684

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in. Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory. For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering. What Is It? The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience. These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously. These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.” What are These Parallel Universes? These parallel universes, also called “braneworlds” by some, hover just beyond your reach.	213.34777627477888
203	137_1-9	Okay, so what do glitches in the simulation prove about our existence in it?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_467976492-2	Well, currently multiverse theory is… just that, a theory.As it stands, the multiverse exists outside our current scientific understanding of reality. Theoretical physics suggests a multiverse is a hypothetical grouping of multiple universes. This means that our Universe could be just one tiny universe in a much larger multiverse where many, possibly even infinite universes, are contained. Interestingly enough, even though much of multiverse theory is hypothetical or imagined, there is some scientific grounding to parts of it. But where to begin? First, not all scientists agree that the multiverse could exist—or that it’s worth exploring. Second, there are actually a few different theories, each which can help to explain certain anomalies in our Universe. (But could also break some currently known things.) Let’s focus on the eternal cosmic inflation theory. This theory starts with the Big Bang. It is suggested that as our Universe expanded into existence, it started off rapidly, then slowed—like when you inflate a balloon. This rapid expansion created our Universe, but also other universes in a vast bubble-like multiverse. While parts of the universe stopped the extremely rapid “inflationary” expansion and “budded off” to become normal space, large parts of the Universe have continued to inflate even now.	156.59040471666958

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_729492685-3	Image via Disney/Marvel That’s where the driving plot of Infinity War comes in, which co-director Joe Russo describes as a heist movie of sorts: “He’s on a hunt.We’re using a bit of a ’90s heist genre component. Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.” So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him. Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power. We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great. This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies. Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	248.0308111273116

MARCO_msmarco_doc_07_145643405-41	The plot sounds creepy and the fact that its based on true events sure makes it more engaging.The film looks and sounds scary as well and there are a few scenes that are bound to get underneath your skin. The film is still kind of disappointing as they don't really explain the movie so well and your left with too many unanswered questions. Sometimes its hard to take the movie seriously as there are some scenes that don't make sense or that the scene kind of feels like a joke. Like said before though, the film should still creep underneath your skin. Richard Gere stars and he gives a very good performance. He makes up for starring in that awful film called Autumn in New York. Laura Linney also does a good and these two really keep the film moving. Mark Pellington directs and he does a good job of keeping the film at a nice pace and making the film look creepy. The ending was done decently and it sure makes you think about what happens. The Mothman Prophecies will leave its mark on you and you may have trouble getting it out of your head when its time to go to sleep. The film is almost two hours long so you may start to get bored if you find the film to be stupid.	226.0090440459608

It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys. Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence. These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal. [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5. Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make. Teach him about respect and acceptance. Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important. Teach him that value is what matters between friends. The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence. Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends. 6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure. To them looks matter a lot. They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely.

Always be very specific when you are giving negative feedback. And make sure your criticism is constructive. Say “Look – this small step in this sum has made the whole answer wrong. Let me explain the step to you again and then do 10 sums like this. That will ensure that you will never make this mistake again.” Do not be grumpy and complaining When teenagers don’t do well in academics – they typically start slipping in other areas of their lives as well. They start keeping their rooms untidy, they neglect their personal hygiene like taking bath and brushing etc. They dress untidily in crushed clothes and so on. This can make you more and more irritated and you may look at your child in disgust whenever she/he is around you and start pointing out everything that is wrong with your child at all times of the day. Do not do this. It can be extremely demotivating. This is the time to support your child and find out why your child is behaving like this with expert help – instead of constantly criticizing her/him.

So abandon your vanity and dig into the work. Besides, there are other people who are hired to worry about your looks. They're called make-up artists, costume designers, and stylists. Choose appropriate material. As a teenager, it's so tempting to pick material that is more mature. But that's a trap.

Besides, there is so much good material out there written for teenagers! Exercise. Don't under-estimate the power of a good workout before you audition.

Appearance Problem: Girls want to look pretty, and the media has made an almost unattainable idea of beauty. Her body is constantly changing as well, so adjusting to this can make it even more difficult. Solution: Watch your teenager and make sure that she does not suddenly start eating too little or adopting strange diets. Make sure she knows that these looks are just fads, and unhealthy eating habits can affect her for the rest of her life. You should also make sure that she does not hang out with friends who have negative habits involving their appearance. 7. Friendship Problem: While friends can make life worthwhile, they can also cause a lot of stress. An ugly fight with a best friend can leave your daughter in tears. Teenagers are still working to develop their social skills, so many teenage friendships are prone to mood swings and instability. Solution: Let your daughter know that fights are normal.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_1626952454-5	Build Self-Worth If your teen only feels good when they get a certain amount of likes on social media or when they fit into a certain size pants, they'll struggle to maintain confidence when situations don't suit their needs.Basing self-worth on superficial things, external circumstances, or other people leads to a lack of confidence in the long run. Help your teen build a healthy and stable foundation for self-worth. Emphasize your values and teach that true self-worth is about living according to those values. Help them see that it’s more important to be kind and caring rather than thin or attractive. 5 ﻿﻿ Balance Freedom with Guidance Micromanaging your teen’s choices will only reinforce that they can’t be trusted to make good decisions independently. It’s important to balance just the right amount of freedom with plenty of guidance. Provide your teen with plenty of opportunities to practice the skills you’ve taught. Let them experience natural consequences and they'll learn from their own mistakes. Over time, they'll develop increased confidence in their ability to make healthy choices. Natural Consequences as an Effective Discipline Tool Help Develop Positive Self-Talk Your teen’s inner monologue will play a major role in how they feel about themselves.	249.76366858455003

MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_154714576-3	Furthermore, social media overload may lead to problems with self-esteem, particularly in teenage girls.“Many girls are bombarded with their friends posting the most perfect pictures of themselves, or they’re following celebrities and influencers who do a lot of Photoshopping and have makeup and hair teams,” Dr Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, says in an article for Childmind.org “If that’s their model for what is normal, it can be very hard on their self-confidence.” Another reason why depression is associated with social media might be what psychologists call displacement – which means what teenagers are not doing during time that’s displaced by social media. This includes mental health-boosting activities such as exercise, sleep and developing talents. “If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness,” Dr. Hamlet explains. “Yes, you get a little dopamine burst whenever you get a notification, or a like on a picture, or a follow request. But those things are addicting without being satisfying.” Sleep and low self-esteem One crucial thing that social media can displace is sleep.	205.88781510742683
221	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life.This might also result in inability to empathize. These sites make kids prone to sensationalism. A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall. Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media. A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison. This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence. However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships. Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”. After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody. Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	205.09635261791163
222	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_28_1670194773-3	Low self-esteem is often mistaken as laziness in teens because this tendency toward a lack of positive action when thinking negatively.Negative patterns of thinking often become a habit for teens as they learn to make sense of the adult world. Your teen may quickly develop negative beliefs about themselves or about the world. Creating Healthy Thought Patterns It may be difficult for your teen to notice evidence of positive things in their life. Explaining logically why they should see something in a positive way is not helpful; it may only leave your teen feeling more frustrated or misunderstood. Instead, help train your teen’s own mind to notice the positive. Model noticing the positive things that are already there or that you or your teen is already doing. Show appreciation for your teen’s behavior and model appreciation for things in your life. A common mistake parents make is to tell their teen to “look on the bright side” when their teen just needs to be listened to. When teens feel heard they will often come up with excellent solutions themselves. 3. Experiencing Breakdowns in Communication Difficulty communicating in a positive way with the people around them can be both a cause and a symptom of low self-esteem. Communication breakdowns will distance your teen from you and other helpful adults, as well as from important peer relationships.	123.93695012246098
223	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_1467599711-5	Positive Affirmations Day – Observe a positive affirmation day at your home once a week for your teenager to feel confident and affable.This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem. For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts. Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves. Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually. Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth. Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought. Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again. Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem. The following activity, if practiced regularly, will help your teen reduce the cycle of negative self-talk and make them a more positive person. This activity is divided into four sections.	119.9373590061332

228	139_1-3	Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?	KILT_35509755-2	"1967 saw Newton's most infamous decision: to not promote Louis Armstrong's recording of the song ""What a Wonderful World"". The song had been written with Armstrong in mind, but when Armstrong, who had recently signed with ABC Records, was recording it, Newton tried to stop the recording session, because he disliked the slow pace. Newton was physically locked out of the studio, and the session continued with him fuming outside. Afterward, Newton put no promotion effort into the single, calling it a mistake. ""What a Wonderful World"" did not do well in the U.S. as a result, though it succeeded elsewhere in the world, including hitting #1 in the UK. It remained essentially unknown in the United States until 20 years later, when it gained popularity after being used in the 1987 film ""Good Morning, Vietnam"".In 1970, Newton became vice-president of ABC Pictures."	426.0059186452392

KILT_932074-7	"Thiele's departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records.One of Thiele's last productions was the Louis Armstrong song ""What A Wonderful World"", which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC's pop division shortly before Armstrong's death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a 'Dixieland'-style number like his earlier hit ""Hello Dolly"". According to Thiele's own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.."	412.00371949214

The song made Louis Armstrong the oldest male to top the UK Singles Chart. Tom Jones later broke this record in 2009. In 1988, Armstrong's recording appeared in the film Good Morning, Vietnam (despite the film being set in 1965 — two years before it was recorded) and was re-released as a single.

Tran Director : Barry Levinson Motion Picture Rating : R Running Time: 2 hours, 1 minute The film that helped make comedian and actor Robin Williams a household name, Good Morning, Vietnam very loosely chronicles the real-life exploits of Armed Forces Radio Service DJ Adrian Cronauer during the Vietnam War.Rebellious and irreverent, he defies his superiors by playing popular rock music for the troops while simultaneously befriending some of the Vietnamese people his country is at war against. Good Morning, Vietnam introduced an entire generation of moviegoers to Williams' manic energy and humor, and it's still an effective showcase of the late star's incredible talent.

While Good Morning Vietnam has anti-war and anti-American undertones, Cronauer was completely supportive of the war effort. Robin Williams’s comedy is completely different from Adrian Cronauer’s: Cronauer was very reserved in his comedic style and stayed mainly within military guidelines. However, the restaurant bombing incident did occur to a point: while the bombing did occur, and Adrian did notice and bring it up to his boss, he did not go against orders and report the news. I think this movie was , but not great. http://books.google.com/books?id=XcuIse9Mp-QC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=beer+with+formaldehyde+vietnam&source=bl&ots=UbjGftmtyx&sig=z0Pgn3G108GtNr1y1RGlq17Bj1g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fe2CUs_gGKyosATqoICADg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=beer%20with%20formaldehyde%20vietnam&f=false http://1001plus.blogspot.com/2012/02/historical-inaccuracy.html http://www.empireonline.com/features/complete-american-history-in-movies/14.asp http://www.historynet.com/adrian-cronauer-air-force-radio-announcer-in-vietnam.htm http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-10-16/news/0210160283_1_adrian-cronauer-robin-williams-military-journalists http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AGood_Morning,_Vietnam http://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics.html This movie appeals to all audiences, as it has little romance, very few war scenes, and almost no historical consistencies.	205.78083813097328

Williams’ spirited portrayal of a zany disc jockey in Good Morning, Vietnam led to a Golden Globe Award for best actor, an Oscar nomination for best actor and box office success for Hollywood’s first Vietnam War comedy. It also forged a special bond between Williams and the people who had worked at AFVN, a military-run radio and TV operation that broadcast news and entertainment to the troops. I interviewed Williams on the movie set, outside Bangkok, in 1987 for Asia Magazine and “Business Update,” a radio program produced by American Public Radio (now Public Radio International). It was clear that Williams had done his homework.	200.93233885565496

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures. At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe. Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion. The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures. It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time. The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers. Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back. The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO. During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives. It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	287.97412268319385

With a 4000-year-old culture, from palaces and temples to natural wonders, China is home to some of the most impressive landmarks in Asia. It’s a nation that is hurtling towards the future at high speed, with impressive new engineering feats popping up each year. The 500-year-old Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks of Asia and according to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei who orbited in 2003, it can’t be seen from the moon. The structure is a collection of walls, towers, fortresses and barracks stretching 21,196km (13,171 miles). The section of the Great Wall that receives the most visitors are Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing. You can explore this famous landmark in Asia as a day trip from the capital. 2- Angkor Wat Angkkor Wat is a stunning Asian landmark to visit.	195.3252250012447

Although there its rich biodiversity has endowed it with plenty of natural attractions, the most famous landmark in this Asian country is a manmade marvel. Standing above the skyline of the nation’s capital, the Petronas Twin Towers is the world’s tallest twin towers (451.8 m). They took six years to build and were designed by César Pelli who created this masterpiece using Islamic concepts and geometric forms, including that of the eight-pointed star. The observation decks on the 86th floor of both towers are connected by a bridge and have stunning views over Kuala Lumpur. 5- Marina Bay Sands Another Asian landmark to see is Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. Although Singapore is rich in colonial history, one of the most stunning architectural landmarks in this country is a contemporary building that dominates the skyline. Marina Bay Sands is a modern ‘ship’ in the sky with amazing views of the island city. Not only is it a landmark in Asia to go and see but you can also stay in it as inside, there’s luxurious accommodation, shopping and stunning infinity pools to.	185.9949677075201
243	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1394706798-5	The restoration and preservation initiatives are being taken up by the government and other non-governmental bodies like the International Friends of the Great Wall and The China Great Wall Society who clean the areas surrounding the most frequently visited areas of the wall and keep a close check on the structural maintenance.Through Western contact with China from the 17th through 20th centuries, the fame of the Great Wall grew and so did tourism. It grew at a whopping rate after President Nixon visited the wall in 1972. Today, a portion of the Great Wall of China, about 80 km from Beijing, is host to about 6 million tourists every year. Many historians have a view that by building a wall of this length, the manpower that went into it, and the deaths reported or assumed during the construction, it would have caused lesser casualties even if another kingdom would have attacked and gotten into a war with China. But from accounts of the Chinese, the wall stands as a representation of their unity and pride. Like it? Share it! « Previous Post Next Post »	162.8083563594846

MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_972701974-6	Walking the Great Wall Today Most people who choose to walk the Great Wall of China today choose to walk either a small portion of it, or pick specific, picturesque spots to do a series of connected hikes.This is because many parts of the wall are very run down, and it’s not possible to walk all the way along the top. In the areas close to Beijing, and other tourist hotspots, the Chinese government has invested a significant amount in the upkeep of the wall, making it a very pleasant, if challenging, hike. The most popular parts of the wall lie near to the capital, including Badaling and Mutianyu. Here you are likely to find the wall crammed with tourists in peak season, making it difficult to walk. However, these sections are particularly well-maintained, and set among glorious scenery, with views over the forest. For a day trek, the section between Jinshanling and Simatai is very popular. This section only attracts tour groups at Jinshanling, and once you set off, you’re likely to meet very few people along the way. The wall is crumbling and broken down in places, but remains accessible, and this 11km hike takes you through some of the region’s finest scenery.	137.81178329791874
245	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander.Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places. In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders. In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea). The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire. Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier. It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads. Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world. In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	134.78984204685548

From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang. Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east. The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian.

It is located the Northern Indian city of Agra, in the southern bank of Yamuna river in India, and its architecture is one of the most significant examples of Mughal architecture style. The complex also houses a mosque and guest house. Made of white marble from Makrana, in Rajasthan, the Taj Mahal combines a range of architectural styles, such as Islamic, Persian and Indian styles. For the construction, other noble materials were used, such as turquoise from Tibet, jade and crystal from China, sapphire from Sri Lanka and Arabia and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. To get to Taj Mahal, you can take a train from Delhi (there are more than 20 trains a day), a bus, or a taxi. Admission to the Taj Mahal starts from Rs. 300 /- for foreigners.	96.418185191229

Happy holidays! Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well! My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such. It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another. So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities. I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing. The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights. Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	220.62936898725457

255	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_msmarco_doc_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization.The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan. The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari. Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute. Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well. Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders. This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details. The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	169.14993556704758

Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza. All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time. The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq. The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters. So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.

There was, first, the romantic idea of honest  expression: that a building should be faithful in revealing its  materials and structure, as Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc  (1814–1879) had argued, without any classical ornament or fake  surface or structure. There was, second, the idea that a  building's form should reflect its plan, its functional  arrangement of interior spaces, as Henry Latrobe and Horatio Greenough  had proposed. There was, third, the belief that each building should  express something new and distinctive in the times (G. W. F. Hegel   [ 1770–1831], Gottfried Semper [ 1803–1879]) and  specifically the new technical resources, such as steel skeletons and electric light and elevators, which suggested  skyscrapers and new forms of building (John Wellborn Root).

Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"". Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century. The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity. — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"". In 1900 Edward Bok of the Curtis Publishing Company, bent on improving American homes, invited architects to publish designs in the Ladies' Home Journal, the plans of which readers could purchase for five dollars."	218.84430705279283

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called ""the best all-time work of American architecture."" His creative period spanned more than 70 years.Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other structures."	180.99467650038423

Fufu is a staple Nigerian food, and it can be eaten with any soup, (that has a lot of assorted meat). However, it takes many hours of strenuous work to prepare. The nutritional value and health benefits of fufu are: 1. It is also very rich in carbohydrates and can supply the body a lot of energy. 2. It is very low in cholesterol. 3. It contains a lot of potassium. Health Risks Just two wraps of fufu contain more than 600 calories. That can make you very fat. Fufu has a glycemic index of 84. It is one of the leading causes of belly fat. So now we have evaluated both of them. This is the moment you have been waiting for. Between fufu and Garri, the most healthy food is… Fufu!

It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian method by mixing and pounding separate equal portions of cassava and green plantain flour thoroughly with water. It is then adjusted to either increase or decrease the viscosity of the fufu depending on personal preferences. Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour. Fufu is often served with groundnut soup, palm nut soup, abunuabunu or light soup.The traditional method is to boil starchy food crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough-like consistency. Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce.	238.44237355797668
290	140_4-4	Is eating fufu without chewing safe?	KILT_12890526-10	In Western and Central Africa, the more common method is to serve a mound of fufu along with a soup (ọbẹ). After washing hands, the diner pinches off a small ball of fufu and makes an indentation with the thumb. This reservoir is then filled with soup, and the ball is eaten. In Nigeria and Ghana, the ball is often not chewed but swallowed whole – in fact, chewing fufu is considered a faux pas. Therefore, fufu not only serves as a food but also as a utensil. One of the low points of Fufu was the smell which lingers on long after the meal, however new and improved species of cassava and improved cassava processing has eliminated the smell of Fufu making it more accepted as a meal.A selection of soups that could be served with fufu includes but not limited to: light (tomato) soup, Palm Nut Soup, groundnut soup, peppersoup, and other types of soups with vegetables such as okra, nkontomire (cocoyam leaves).	220.96079757093503

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish. No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof. The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights. A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal. Thank God we know better.

Archeological artifacts have been discovered in Senegal and the Gambia, such as pre-historic pottery, the 8th century stones, and 14th century burial mounds, but, states Gamble, these provide no evidence that link them exclusively to the Wolof ethnic group. Their name as the Wolof first appears in the records of 15th century Portuguese travelers.With the Arab conquests of West Africa in last centuries of the 1st millennium CE, one theory states that the Wolof people were forced to move into north and east Senegal where over time villages developed into autonomous states such as Baol, Kayor, Saloum, Dimar, Walo and Sine the overall ruling state being that of Jolof who came together voluntarily to form the Jolof Empire.	316.94745804549984

This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_02_420075955-1	Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital. Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s. A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time. The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return. This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return. Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme. How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example. Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month. The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month. The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest. This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.	258.4773849899939

Spotting Ponzi schemes Common types of Ponzi scheme operate under a variety of names including “high yield investment program” and “high yield debentures”. Their common characteristics are very high returns with no clear underlying business to generate them. More complex forms of Ponzi scheme can be harder to detect. They may well appear to be legitimate investments. They may even be part of an investment that includes both legitimate and Ponzi elements. An example of the latter is an investment or finance company that offers very high returns to depositors, and does lend the money (as a real finance company would) to make returns, but does so knowing that the return on loans will not suffice to cover the interest paid to depositors. Returns that are too consistent are also a reason for suspicion. This was a characteristic of the fraudulent fund run by Bernard Madoff.	121.2055149882217

MARCO_msmarco_doc_18_1642035430-6	"Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme Theoretically it is not impossible at least for certain entities operating as Ponzi scheme to ultimately ""succeed"" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate.For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ). Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse. Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	167.9700575026509

Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release. Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds. In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.

It requires more work, though: You have to buy the right to start a franchise and start recruiting more people like yourself. The recruits will often pay the recruiter a cut of their profits. You can read How Pyramid Schemes Work to understand more about that process.	118.62267779393004
342	141_2-11	What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?	KILT_48732-8	"They are related in the sense that both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are forms of financial fraud. However, pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money to the top of the pyramid. They fail simply because there are not sufficient people. Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of ""Robbing Peter to pay Paul""—early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, a scheme such as the Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998) in India can be called a Ponzi scheme. Some Ponzi schemes can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two."	151.27011073334145

As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:BULLET::::- In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value. A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.BULLET::::- Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme)."	133.60744595900178
344	141_2-11	What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?	KILT_47185-0	"Ponzi schemeA Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit""."	118.81751925265417

349	141_1-3	What else about scams should I be aware of asides from guaranteed returns?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_40_221671898-2	"These scammers use a variety of tactics to get your credit or debit card number and as much personal information as possible.Their goal is a quick payoff by running up purchases or cash advances on your accounts or selling the information to other fraudsters. One of the most common scams is an offer of low interest rates or a chance to reduce your debt for a nominal fee up front. Another approach is to call or text fake fraud alerts that appear to be from your credit card company. Many consumers complain about receiving these calls multiple times a day, even if they don't have a credit card. Such calls almost always begin with the caller asking you to ""verify"" your account information. Remember that the scammer's goal is identity theft, and statistics show that any engagement with a scam caller exponentially increases the likelihood that you will become a victim. To help you avoid credit card phone scams, follow these tips: If you receive an unsolicited or automated call from a company offering to lower your interest rate, don't hang on, hang up. Never provide or confirm personal or financial information during any call that you didn't initiate. Never respond to ""yes or no"" questions or push any phone buttons if prompted to opt-out of future calls."	148.78186215429014

MARCO_msmarco_doc_24_839788292-3	As you are probably aware, there are online savings accounts with higher APY.Banks like ING and Ally Bank are currently offering something like 0.8%, which would translate into $5,000 earning $40 in interest per year.) The APY is the most important detail in the email. But there are a few subtle points that also merit discussion. Payment frequency: interest paid monthly This is a very important detail. This tells you the bank only credits the interest to your account once a month on a specified day. It helps to know when the interest is paid, especially if you are closing the account. You can lose out on interest if you close out just before a payment. For instance, if you expect an interest payment of say $50 on the 15th of the month, but you happen to close the account on the 14th, then you would lose out on that $50. In the account mentioned in the email, we expect to earn $2.50 a year, so that comes out to about 20 cents each month paid on a specific day. Balance calculation: daily collected balances This is another important detail. Unlike a CD where you invest a fixed amount of money, a money market account will change depending on withdrawals and deposits.	127.0434012603946
