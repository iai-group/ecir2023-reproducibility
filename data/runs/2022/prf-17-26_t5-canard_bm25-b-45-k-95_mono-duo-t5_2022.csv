Johnson is also expected to focus on climate change, a top priority for the United Kingdom ahead of the COP26 conference it is due to host in November 2021. UK Secretary for Business Kwasi Kwarteng has indicated that Johnson will be seeking coordinate action on carbon border taxes, green finance, the phase-out of coal and helping poorer countries to set up climate change. While the taxes have been backed by the EU and US, EU climate ambassador Mark Vanhuekelen indicated that Australia may oppose the measures. Another expected topic of discussion is international co-ordination on economic policies. United States Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has signaled a revival in American multilateralism, focusing on the need for continued economic support.	401.8475965684973

The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit. Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday. Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.” Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050."	397.8562759984254

WAPO_RG7DHDRJR4I6XHBBHTCQDUEYD4-0	"LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasn't talked much about climate change since he declared in February that 2020 would be a ""year of climate action. "" The global pandemic and economic crisis eclipsed climate on his agenda. But he pivoted back to the topic Wednesday, announcing a ""green industrial revolution"" he said would address both climate and pandemic-related concerns — helping the country to become emissions-neutral while creating a quarter-million jobs and reviving the battered economy. Among the notable elements of his 10-point plan is a ban on new sales of gas and diesel cars to start in 2030. That's five years earlier than Johnson said in February and 10 years earlier than the plan before that. “The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand,” he said in a statement. Johnson, head of the right-of-center Conservative Party, wants to highlight Britain’s global leadership role before it is due to host COP26, a major international climate summit, next November."	340.2046411593783

9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that.Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage. And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor. Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires. Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .” Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death. Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks. As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	255.0472534335568

MARCO_msmarco_doc_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts.Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health. Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	132.9442679863423

Those most vulnerable to climate related health effects - such as children, the elderly, the poor, and future generations - face disproportionate risks.	129.6266824901104

KILT_24224089-24	"According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment report from 2007, Argentina will be impacted by climate change with differing affects depending on the region of Argentina in question. A declining trend in precipitation may be observed in south-west Argentina while expected increases in sea-level rise (SLR), extreme weather and climatic variability are very likely to affect coastal areas of the Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. Stress on water availability and quality has been documented where lower precipitation and/or higher temperatures occur. For example, droughts related to La Niña create severe restrictions for water supply and irrigation demands in central western Argentina. Additionally, glaciers in Latin America have receded dramatically in the past decades, and many of them have disappeared completely. IPCC predicts this trend to continue and perhaps even worsen.

In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020. The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow. For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.

It was the 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 11th session of the Meeting of the Parties (CMP) to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.The conference negotiated the Paris Agreement, a global agreement on the reduction of climate change, the text of which represented a consensus of the representatives of the 196 parties attending it. The agreement enters into force when joined by at least 55 countries which together represent at least 55 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 April 2016 (Earth Day), 174 countries signed the agreement in New York,According to the organizing committee at the outset of the talks, the expected key result was an agreement to set a goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2 °C"" Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels."	139.67938995361328

WAPO_MFJTN65BNZCQTCCG5CUTO6SJOM-0	The latest round of global climate negotiations just concluded in the coal city of Katowice, Poland. This was the 24th meeting of the “conference of the parties” (COP) to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change — and the most important meeting since COP 21, the 2015 Paris agreement.   What was at stake? This year’s negotiations were about finalizing the “Paris rule book” — and they somewhat miraculously did, with an accord on the rules finally reached Saturday. The Paris agreement ushered in a different approach to reducing greenhouse gases, after previous false starts. Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve. Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.	138.02397951926105

As uncertainty loomed Wednesday about the future of U.S. domestic and foreign policy, the rest of the world was left to react to the country’s official departure from the Paris accord — a move that Trump had been promising since he took office, saying he considered it an unfair deal for the country. A joint statement from the leaders of Chile, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United Nations expressed “regret” at the U.S. withdrawal. But they insisted that the world would carry on regardless. “We remain committed to working with all U.S. stakeholders and partners around the world to accelerate climate action, and with all signatories to ensure the full implementation of the Paris agreement,” the group wrote, adding, “There is no greater responsibility than protecting our planet and people from the threat of climate change.	122.06915322318672

Biden is the oldest person ever elected to the White House. He served as the 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Before becoming the Vice President, he had represented Delaware as a United States Senator from 1973 to 2009. Born in a middle-class family in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden learned the value of hard word, determination and perseverance from his parents who always encouraged him to stand up for himself and bounce back after failures. As a child he used to stammer but he overcame this problem by memorizing and reciting long passages in front of the mirror. He went on to study law and also developed interest in politics. He joined the Democratic Party and became active in politics alongside managing his legal career. He won the 1972 U.S. Senate election in Delaware when he was just 29 and assumed office the next year. A devastating family tragedy threatened to end his career, but he persevered on bravely. He proved to be a popular senator and set his ambitions higher. He was selected as the running-mate for presidential nominee Barack Obama in 2008 and the Obama-Biden ticket went on to win the election. They won again in 2012.	181.45019780873557

WAPO_ZLELEVX3HRGD5J427C6GSFMCVA-0	President-elect Joe Biden, during a conversation with a small group of journalists on Wednesday, conceded that he is entering office not with a black box, but with “black corners in the box.” This was a concession that the transition has been incomplete and frustrating to a large degree. This has not been the case across the entire current administration, Biden explained, but in a number of areas, “the professionals are at a loss” to explain where things stand. Chaos and lack of clarity are hobbling the current administration and are making the transition particularly difficult. “I can’t tell if I have a clear view of where the landmines are,” Biden confessed. In a noteworthy revelation, the president-elect said he has consulted Republican appointees who are no longer in office to try to get a handle on what is going on. (He also confirmed his team has not received a Defense Department briefing since Dec. 17 or Dec. 18.)	158.7196186943911
36	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_BE2M3KWIBRDTBAKILLO25Z6OAM-4	China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases. “The U.S. role here is somewhat schizophrenic — pushing coal and dissing science on the one hand, but also working hard in the room for strong transparency rules,” said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit based in Virginia. “Over the long haul, making the agreement operational will do more to strengthen climate ambition than any immediate political signals.” In a statement, the U.S. State Department said that while the administration’s position on the Paris agreement — the U.S. is leaving — remains unchanged, the latest meeting helped the U.S. with “holding our economic competitors accountable” when it comes to adequately reporting their greenhouse gas emissions. “The United States is not taking on any burdens or financial pledges in support of the Paris Agreement and will not allow climate agreements to be used as a vehicle to redistribute wealth,” the statement said.	122.15190262161197
37	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_da552161e78f2c80204622838bdaaed2-2	The United States sets its own targets, in pledges made to the United Nations, and like every other country, it is supposed to increase them over time. Thus, in the end, the United States does as much as it can or wants to under Paris. In fairness, the agreement certainly does assume that all countries are earnestly committed to cutting emissions. The current U.S. pledge, to reduce emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, is fairly ambitious, and without such a pledge by the world’s second largest emitter, the Paris agreement would have been harder to reach. Equally surprising is Trump’s assertion that China “doesn’t adhere” to the Paris agreement. China’s commitments, too, are self-generated under the agreement, but no less significant for that reason.  Getting on the same page with the world’s top emitter, as President Obama did in late 2014, was key to setting the world on the road to achieving Paris.	121.49193500122055
38	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_cd9f196be06356970b1e70a81e2ea604-5	The United States, as the world’s second largest emitter, is central to the Paris accord, both symbolically and also mathematically. Indeed, the country lowering its emissions as promised by the Obama administration could determine whether the world itself is positioned to curb global warming significantly in coming years. According to an analysis by the think tank Climate Interactive, the Paris agreement pledges would shift the world from a path in which global emissions are expected to rise significantly out to the year 2030 (as economies grow and populations boom), onto one in which emissions remain relatively flat over the next 13 years. That’s not enough to hit the 2 degrees Celsius goal, but it is enough to keep global warming at least somewhat under control. However, the group found, 21 percent of that achievement — or about one-fifth of the emissions cuts — depend on the United States.	102.95641821995378

MARCO_msmarco_doc_39_196501676-20	During the annual Conference of the Parties (COP), nations share information on emissions, policies, and practices, and attempt to develop strategies for addressing climate change.The IPCC consults experts to assess climate change science and presents policy-relevant information outlining how nations can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impact and risks of this global threat. In 1997, the members of the UNFCCC negotiated the Kyoto Protocol, a legally binding agreement that compelled developed nations to reduce greenhouse emissions over the course of two commitment periods (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). At the 2015 Conference of the Parties, countries adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016, less than a year after it was adopted. As of August 2020, 189 parties (188 countries plus the European Union) have ratified the Paris Agreement. The parties agree to limit global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” (3.6 Fahrenheit) this century. Participating countries are expected to submit their own country-specific emission reduction targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions. In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are meant to serve as a blueprint for action on critical development issues, such as ending poverty and hunger.	232.4895795669945

Waddell DVM, DACVECC, in Small Animal Critical Care Medicine, 2009 INTRODUCTION Colloid osmotic pressure (COP) is the physiochemical phenomenon that occurs when two solutions with different colloid concentrations are separated by a semipermeable membrane.The particles contributing to COP (and the particles that they may hold with them because of their electrical charge) do not pass readily through the semipermeable membrane. This is in contrast to most crystalloid particles such as electrolytes, glucose, and other metabolites, which pass readily through the membrane. COP is determined with a patient's blood sample in reference to normal saline rather than pure water because normal saline is more representative of the fluid in the interstitial space. COP should be thought of as the osmotic pressure exerted by plasma proteins and their associated electrolytes, because the electrolytes contribute significantly to the COP. Albumin and its associated cations provide approximately 60% to 70% of the plasma oncotic pressure and globulins provide the remaining 30% to 40%. Oncotic pressure is defined as the osmotic pressure exerted by colloids in solution, so the terms COP and oncotic pressure can be used interchangeably; colloid oncotic pressure, a commonly used misnomer, is redundant.	314.703796334014

You can go to Hello Wonderful for print-out templates, or simply make your own paper and cardstock. Things to Make for Mother’s Day: Pampering Gifts for Mom 4. Decorated Serving Trays (for breakfast in bed!) Moms dish it up and serve it out on the daily. Why not beat her to the punch on Mother’s Day and bring her her favorite coffee or tea or breakfast dish before she even has a chance to step out of bed in the morning. I remember growing up, my brother and I would make scrambled eggs in the microwave every Mother’s Day and bring them, along with some nuked grits, to our mom.	294.6042661774027

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own. Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients. Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though! To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well. Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture. Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover. The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	286.9148160378836

If you want to learn how to make your own DIY face makeup remover, there are step-by-step instructions below! I have tried a lot of homemade makeup removers. My go-to is generally the Oil Cleansing Method, but sometimes I am admittedly lazy, and want to be able to remove my makeup while watching tv on the couch. You feel me, right? I find that makeup remover wipes are highly convenient for such times, and will occasionally find myself buying them at the store. But there are two things that bother me when buying makeup remover wipes: they’re expensive, and they contain unnecessary chemicals that dry out my facial skin. (Not trying to call out any specific companies here, but one “ultra-calming” makeup remover I’ve tried contains isononyl isononanoate, pentaerythrityl tetraethylhexanoate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, and 20 more ingredients.

Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10.

In our house we buy each child a new ornament every year and of course it all starts with the first one! The idea is to gift them all the ornaments when they move to their own home so that they have a bunch of ornaments to get started. I copied this tradition from a friend’s mom and I just love the idea of having ornaments that tell a story. Each ornament can represent something the child was into that year or special event that year. Baby’s first Christmas ornament can be simple and homemade or a pure silver spoon – it’s entirely up to you!

69	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_15_1872813287-3	So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils.Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin. So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion. But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion. Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils. Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well. So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc. Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.	127.85533276629212
70	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_105794544-8	You can use a single essential oil or a combination of several—it's completely customizable.If you aren’t sure what scents you like, you might try: Lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent Rose oil for a classic floral fragrance Citrus oils like sweet orange and grapefruit for a bright, energetic scent Patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent Myrrh, frankincense, or benzoin for a dramatic, resinous scent Tip: Always use high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oil for your lotion. Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin. 2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil. At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance. If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again. However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil. Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted. 3 Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color. These products are oil-soluble, so they're perfect for this recipe.	124.09649708579671
71	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_24_1169299216-5	The type of essential oils you use will depend on the purpose of the lotion: Peppermint and ginger for cooling massage lotions after exercise.Calendula and chamomile for sensitive skin. Argan oil and patchouli for anti-aging face creams. Aqueous vs. Oil Lotions The main difference between a lotion and body butter is how much water is in it. With most creams, more than half of the tub is water. When you’re making home-made lotions, the problem with water is that it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. This means that to keep the lotion fresh, you need to add some sort of preservative. Some essential oils, such as tea tree, make good preservatives, so if you are planning on adding those to your blend, then that may be enough to preserve a small tub of lotion. If you don’t want to add preservatives, though, you’re going to struggle. Body butter is less likely to go rancid quickly, but a lot of people don’t like them because of the texture. Water-based oils are a good choice for those people, and there are some active ingredients such as rose water, aloe juice, and witch hazel that are water soluble and work well in water-based lotions.	123.11426467230832

MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1188224872-5	Equipment Measuring cups and spoons Medium mixing bowl Hand mixer 8-ounce jar or container A hand mixer is the easiest way to combine the ingredients, but it can be manually stirred as well.Step-by-Step Instructions Put the shea/cocoa butter into a bowl and mix it alone until it’s soft. Add the hemp seed oil in small amounts, mixing in between. Add the cornstarch or arrowroot powder and the other oils. Mix the lotion until it is to the desired texture. Notes If your hemp lotion comes out too thick for your liking, add a little more hemp seed oil and a few more drops of your secondary oil. Adding more essential oil may make the scent too strong. If you used unrefined hemp seed oil, make sure to keep the hemp lotion somewhere out of the sunlight, as that will shorten its shelf life. You can also make a thicker hemp lotion, like body butter, from this same formula minus the cornstarch/arrowroot powder. Start by melting 3 tablespoons of beeswax then adding the shea/cocoa butter and mixing. Then add the oils and stir. Pour this into a container and let it set.	114.74030037852935

MARCO_msmarco_doc_12_1463786556-21	Melt the mixture and stir in order to blend all the ingredients together.Remove the bowl from the heater water and allow the mixture to cool to body temperature. In order to keep the texture smooth, stir the mixture from time to time. When the concoction has cooled down, bring 8 ounces of distilled water to body temperature and place it inside a blender. Gently add a thin stream of oil into the water, with the blender turned on a low setting. A few minutes in, you should notice that the mixture gains a creamy texture, which will get smoother the more you mix it. Those of you that plan to add essential oils to the recipe, pour in just a few drops, so that you can gradually increase the fragrance up to a point where it feels enough for you.

75	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone.Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing? Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs? Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer. Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device? If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone. Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out. This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying. Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance. What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs? It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting. Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	212.2286467681406

Choose a brand: At present, there are many kinds of domestic and foreign mobile phone brands on the market, consumers should mainly consider the reputation of the brand mobile phone manufacturers, after-sales service, mobile phone quality and related accessories are easy to buy.3 . Compare the function, select the appearance, and look at the demand point: It is not that the more functions the better, many functions may not be used by themselves, so it is necessary to measure their own needs and make comparisons. Know if you have a passion for a particular brand / system? Or do you need to take a clearer picture? Or is it more smooth to play games without fever? Or do you need the latest 5G phone? Or do you need to be waterproof and anti-falling? Or a big battery? Know what your needs are and sort them in order of importance. 4. Look at the configuration: To buy a mobile phone, you need to pay attention to CPU type, memory capacity, memory, screen size, camera, battery capacity, etc., and choose the highest configuration for the demand point you are most concerned about at the same price.	132.52746960287914
77	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_69096130-9	Other tips and tricks you should know There are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when buying a new phone.First of all, don’t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you’re used to. Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi. Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn’t mean it makes bad phones. As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews. And don’t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it’s without faults. For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard. Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money. Also, don’t just go for the latest phones out there. Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model. A lot of the time the latest versions of phones are only minor upgrades over their predecessors but cost a lot more.	124.51008531308617

MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_1007386097-5	If the phones on display don’t impress you, then you have the option of coming with your preferred phone.The only requirements are that the phone should be unlocked, not specific to a particular carrier, and it should be compatible with GSM Networks. Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular. Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone. Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones. If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display. Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers. Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them. Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan. After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward. Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose. The least you can pay for the plan is $15 plus an additional $5 for data and unlimited minutes.	205.33851819230767

Here are 10 tips to help you with your next purchase. 1. Form Follows Function You want to be sure you are purchasing a phone that will deliver all the features and capabilities you want and need. Rather than think in terms of what you used your last phone for, think instead of what you would like your next phone to be able to do! If email is important to you, that instantly presents WinMo phones and BlackBerries as options. If texting is your thing, then a spacious, comfortable keypad is critical. 2. Get the Best Deal you Can There are more options for purchasing phones today than ever. Changes in carrier policies and new regulations allow customers to, say, purchase a phone on the internet and bring it to a carrier to have it activated. Some carriers, like Verizon, set up kiosks at local events and add special offers on top of your 2-year renewal discount.	181.07537323426368

If you’re anything like me, or you’re around my age you will have likely read the Harry Potter books growing up. I was 10 when the first book was released in 1997 and although I didn’t read it that year by the time The Order of the Phoenix was released in 2003 I was queuing up outside WHSmith at Midnight dressed in my robes to be one of the first to get my hands on the latest adventures of Harry and the gang. As an avid reader and one that particularly likes fantasy books at that, I still have all my original Harry Potter Books. Unfortunately for me, none of them are worth anything (I’ve checked!).

MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_76429195-3	The Moto G7 has a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the affordable sticker price.A 6.2-inch Full HD+ display ensures all of your apps, games, and more look sharp and colorful, and the dual 12MP + 5MP rear camera combo takes pretty good photos all things considered. You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10. Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app). And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers. We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there. Pros: Build quality is great Large and colorful display Cameras are pretty decent Works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Alexa access is hands-free Cons: Doesn't have NFC Best Alternative Moto G7 Don't like the OnePlus 8?	132.32047017570585

Software updates are also a concern here just like they are with the G7 Power, but we'd expect to see an Android 10 update here before it arrives on the Power sibling. Pros: Glass design is really sleek Large, sharp display Dual rear cameras Storage is expandable up to 512GB Moto Display and Moto Actions are excellent Cons: Motorola's track record for software updates Performance is fine Best Mid-Ranger Moto G7 The best mid-range phone for TracFone.

The excellent processor combined with the nice screen and other features make this a phone that will be a popular option to upgrade to from older devices. Moto G7 Optimo (Play) VS Moto G7 Optimo MAXX (Power) Tracfone released both these phones for use on their network and they share some of the same features while also having a few key differences. Let's quickly break that down for you. The G7 Optimo MAXX has a larger screen (6.2"" vs 5.7""), 1 GB more RAM, larger battery (5,000 mAh vs 3,000) and slightly better camera. The Optimo and Optimo MAXX have the same processor, storage and Android OS. They are also both available for about the same price from Tracfone. For users who don't mind the larger form factor and screen, the Optimo MAXX is the clear choice. But some users may prefer the smaller G7 Optimo, and it still makes for a great option."	103.42137898877264

MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_945711051-4	Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone.Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7. For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back. Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone. The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker. The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display. Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall. The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	480.46833007463147
94	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen.Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant. Blacks are much darker and inkier as well. When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too. That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles. One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent. You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes. Samsung did not add water protection to the A50. The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent. Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video? Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting. And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	456.5776603996468

The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7. I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless. The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame. This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_43_1625245214-4	"Another thing that I've done that has been really helpful for time management is using an app called Focus Time.I do a 20- to 35-minute sprint timed with Focus Time in the morning before the kids are even up. When I get back from that, I pick the biggest work task of the day that I want to get accomplished, and get to it. The most important aspects of life for me are health and family, so I focus on getting those managed well because when that is done, everything else naturally falls into place. You have to decide what aspects of life and business are most important to you, get them running smoothly and allow your forward movement to fall into place. 5. Approach every day as a school day. When I coach entrepreneurs, I tell them, ""Fail forward and fail fast, and every day will be a school day."" What that means is that there is always a lesson to be had and failure is one of our greatest teachers. You have to be open to every experience as an opportunity to learn something new.

The last thing you want is to run out of time and willpower on a given day, and end up skipping a day. Knowing exactly what you want will help you get it. 4. Keep a Daily Log Whether it’s a calendar or large notebook, take the time to jot down how far you ran each day and how your run went. Write what you want to improve tomorrow. Evaluating your run and making plans for future runs will grow your excitement to get out again tomorrow.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_1127579161-55	"What I Talk about When I Talk about Running Writing Haruki Murakami started running about the same time he started writing novels (at age 33).He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"". Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin. Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being. ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void... ""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [ clouds]. What I should be looking at is inside me."	181.2216528226145

The most common option would be carrying the iPhone in the pocket of your shorts, but the constant bounce can kill your rhythm, even it does just jump out of the pocket during the run. Unless you’re wearing a running vest or a sports bra that comes with a slip pouch to place your device, your best bet is to get a running armband for iPhone.

All You Need To Know April 26, 2017          / Running Health Q&A / By Jessica Natalie Maybe you are that runner who enjoys listening to music or tracking your mileage whenever you are out on a run. That said, when it comes to doing both things, your smartphone might be your best bet. Especially in this day and age, technology is not only so readily available at our disposal, but also a great way to do just about anything, from running to working to entertainment and everything in between. That said, you would like to carry your phone while you run, as means of tracking your progress and listening to music, but you are concerned about just how to carry it around with you. Especially since you will be running and bouncing up and down on the road, you do not want your phone to bounce up and down with you, either.

Last updated on March 31, 2019 Last Updated on May 2, 2019 by Husain Parvez The two most popular smartphones are the iPhone and Android phones. They are developed by different companies and also have unique features. Smartphone buyers are often torn between these types. The choice of which one to pick depends largely on the specifications and capabilities which you are searching for. While there were a number of other smartphone alternatives such as Windows Phone and Blackberry, they have since gone obsolete. Therefore, majority of smartphones today are either iPhones or Android phones. IPhone vs. Android: What Should You Get? Here are some characteristics that can guide your choice as you pick the right one. Apple vs Android – Easy To Use If you’re searching for a smartphone that is easy to use, the iPhone is a better pick. This smartphone has a simple interface that is easy to learn, use and maintain. It provides you with a home-screen which contains a collection of icons. You can also personalize it with a photo.

Apple makes a bunch of phones now, so you do have plenty of options across a range of price points – the iPhone SE 2020 is the cheapest, however. With Android, you have potentially thousands of options from loads of different phone companies – from Samsung to OPPO and smaller nice brands like TCL and RealMe. Android phones come in all shapes and sizes, so you do have more choice, and each Android phone maker does things a little differently too – so no two Android phones are exactly the same. Save With Android, you’re reliant on Google services, things like Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, and with iPhone, you use Apple’s services – iCloud, Mail, iMessage, and the App Store. In terms of internal specs and components, iPhones and Android phones are similar – they all have modems, 5G/4G chipsets, internal storage, advanced camera units, and all the other things that make smartphones actually smart. There are some distinct differences between iPhone and Android phones, though, and the most noticeable one is that Android phones tend to be more customizable.	163.8255095082568

Author: Lindsay Ingram Publish date: Nov 28, 2014 1:18 PM EST Here are 10 Android phones that are better than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- iPhone users almost have it easy when choosing a new phone, currently the best options are the big iPhone 6, or the bigger iPhone 6 Plus. Choosing an Android phone can be a bit harder since there are so many options available. With that wide selection comes more competition, though, and there's an argument to be made that some of the phones are even better than the iPhone, no matter which iPhone you're talking about. What makes an Android phone better than an iPhone is all based on what you value in a phone. Maybe you want a more durable, waterproof phone, or a phone with a different design and more color options. Maybe you really, really want a stylus and a huge display. Or it could be as simple as you prefer to be locked into Google's ecosystem instead of Apple's because hey, no one company's products are right for everyone.	153.0508629719261

Who said too many choices is a good thing. Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision. A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me. IPhone did that. People don’t grow fans out of thin air. There has to be stuff backing it. Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years. Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized. So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones. Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity.Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury. 1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again. They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run. Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis. And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance. As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first. Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly. For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace. These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport. You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	298.50046527580344

In fact, she tells all of her clients who have taken several months off of running to spend the first couple of weeks focusing on walking, not running. (Try pairing your strength workouts with walking a few miles several times a week to get some miles under your feet.) Because here’s the cold, hard truth: “If you don't have a long history of running behind you, you may need to start over at the beginning with your training,” she says.

119	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_964601708-3	Here's what to do during your break.Make it last. Take at least one three- or four-week break each year. Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training. Time it right. The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes. Stay in shape. During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times. For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started). Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do. For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout. The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity. In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness. You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.	242.25085087271145

MARCO_msmarco_doc_52_483672706-4	Any kind of strength training.Cool Down For Running After running, a good cool down can be a brisk walk for 2-3 minutes, gradually tapering your pace or stroll. Sprinting is the same concept, but start with jogging, then taper down to walking. This will be followed by static stretches that aim to increase the range of motion and flexibility of your lower body. Start with standing stretches, then seated stretches. As you can see, it’s a gradual pace to bring your body down to normal levels and relaxation. Cool Down for Resistance & Strength Training After resistance training, you will want to do a mobility cool down routine. This involves gentle bodyweight movements and stretching. It’s like a yoga flow, where you move in an out of movements, holding stretches for 5-10 seconds (although you can hold stretches longer if you want, as after a workout it is fine). We have an example of this kind of routine further below (see 4-Min Cool Down Routine). Note: Make sure you emphasize stretches for areas you worked most in your workout. So, if it was an upper body day, focus on your upper body more. If it was a full body day, you can do an evenly targeted full body cool down.	137.49366205185652

Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength. What is a confused body to do?! As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training). It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances. While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time. The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_576504017-2	Jump rope is notoriously popular among boxers, but might as well be among swimmers too.Jumping rope is a simple dryland cardio workout which is great for improving foot speed, agility, coordination, and shoulder strength, all while burning a ton of calories. Another huge bonus of this dryland cardio workout is the fact that it’s straightforward, cheap, and easily accessible. You don’t need a lot of space to jump rope and it can be done practically anywhere. Personally, I like to do some jump rope before getting in the water to help warm up and activate my muscles. Something as simple as 5 minutes of jumping rope is a great way to warm up the body and ensure that you don’t get injured in the pool. An additional benefit of jumping rope is the fact that this is very low impact on the body, similar to swimming. Jumping rope doesn’t place a lot of stress on the joints and is easy to recover from after a workout. If you want to incorporate this into your training regimen as a dryland cardio workout I recommend doing interval jumping, similar to interval training in the pool. Do 1-2 minutes of continuous skipping and then rest 30 seconds.	151.2376087787561

Safety: Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height. Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits. That’s the height you’re going for. If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope. Duration and frequency: 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space. Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete. If you’re a beginner: Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet. Do this move for 15 seconds. Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope. Do this move for 15 seconds.

This simulates the effect of having disconnected the battery from the device. If this works, this may unlock the device. If doing the regular restart won’t help, then try this: Press and hold the Volume Down button first and don’t release it. While holding it down, press and hold the Power key. Keep both keys held down for 10 seconds or more. The second restart procedure tries to simulate the effects of removing the battery pack. On older devices, disconnecting the battery is often an effective way in fixing unresponsive devices. If nothing changed though, proceed to the next suggestions. Rebooting your device regularly at least once every week can be beneficial. If you tend to forget things, we suggest that you configure your phone to reboot on its own. You can schedule it to do this task by doing these steps: Open Settings app. Tap Device Care. Tap the 3-dot at the top. Select Auto restart.	155.18897888163335

152	135_2-7	So what's a better alternative to running on an empty stomach?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_09_17958275-2	Is it better to run on an empty stomach?First, consider the time and effort. If you’re running less than 60 minutes at an easy pace, you may not need to eat anything—your body has enough glycogen (its preferred fuel source) stored to power you through, but you should focus on refueling properly afterward. Any run lasting longer than 60 minutes or performed at a vigorous to intense effort may require some extra fuel to keep you going. That said, everyone is different and multiple factors influence this so if you find you’re hitting the wall on most runs around mile four or 45 minutes in, then you’ll adjust your fuel plan accordingly. If you choose to eat before the run, in order to get that food in and digested, one option is to see if you can go to bed a half-hour earlier and then drag yourself out of bed thirty minutes earlier, which would give you time to digest a more substantial meal. But, I realize how precious every minute of sleep can be, and also how difficult it can be to get in bed earlier, so here are some other ideas. What should I do before running in the morning?	225.6780722616468

154	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_971491333-4	Training duration and intensity are severely restricted by the lack of glycogen.Therefore, the intended training stimulus is rather low. A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance. Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores. This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism. The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles. However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance. At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health. Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training. This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast. So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes. Choose a low intensity (at a recovery run or conversation pace). You should drink a glass of water before your run.	186.12149007909463

Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure.On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate. The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon. In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal. It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	140.1287580274511

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell. At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty. G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison. Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC). Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.

In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that a tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972, had an 18 + 1⁄2 minute gap. Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, saying that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, but her story was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up. Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office."	98.26137873082916

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power. Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever. The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat. The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	184.70516441150903

Due to this scandal, the republican party suffered and moved to the right on the political scale. Congress tried to limit presidential power in an effort to ensure a similar scandal never occurs again. Further, the American people also grew weary of big government. Further, as a result of Watergate, the presidential office was weakened, allowing Soviets to expand. In addition, Watergate also led to the North Vietnamese regaining territory because the president was too busy with Watergate.

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal. The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded. Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president. Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms. But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation. 1. The Supreme Court remained supreme. It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.	245.92673141160049

MARCO_msmarco_doc_27_1281136783-1	The Watergate Scandal: Summary & Significance | SchoolWorkHelper The Watergate Scandal: Summary & Significance The Watergate Scandal was a series of crimes committed by the President and his staff, who were found to have spied on and harassed political opponents, accepted illegal campaign contributions and covered up their own misdeeds. On June 17, 1972, The Washington Post published a small story. In this story, the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate. These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers. The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deeply into the story. Their names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward; they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime. The reporters suspected that the break-in had been ordered by other White House officials. In a press conference in August of 1972, President Nixon said that nobody in the White House staff was involved in the crime. Most of the public accepted Nixon’s word and dropped the investigation.	125.04140883497894

The men were caught, and money that they had on them was traced back to a slush fund used by a committee to re-elect the president.

Game over. Deep Throat was the legendary anonymous source for Post reporter Bob Woodward when he was reporting on President Richard Nixon in 1972 and 1973, who was made even more famous by Hal Holbrook’s portrayal of him as a shadowy underground parking-lot denizen in the movie version of Woodward and Carl Bernstein’s book, “All the President’s Men.” Woodward never publicly revealed who Deep Throat was. The secret held despite extravagant third-party investigations (former Nixon aide Leonard Garment wrote an entire book about it in 2000, “In Search of Deep Throat,” fingering the wrong guy). It wasn’t until 2005, as he neared death, that Mark Felt, a high-ranking FBI official during the Nixon years, stepped out of the metaphoric shadows and declared that he was Woodward’s source.	140.5703629637137

When five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972, Felt was the man chosen to head up the investigation. His mission was to determine the involvement, if any, of the White House. After being pressured from upstairs to stay clear, Felt decided the press was the only way to expose the corruption and the White House’s complicity. Using the moniker Deep Throat, he met regularly with Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, helping them uncover the full story which ultimately lead to Nixon’s resignation. 2) Columbia HealthCare John Schilling, a reimbursement supervisor for Columbia Healthcare, together with four colleagues, brought a FCA case against their employers, as well as accountant KPMG Peat Marwick.

This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence. Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	237.21756360198424

Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	167.3920885999396

197	137_1-5	"Deep. What do other philosophers think about Bostrom's ""simulation argument""?"	MARCO_msmarco_doc_30_1549247804-2	Bostrom’s biggest argument for this belief is called the simulation argument, which he states that, if ancestor simulations are something an advanced civilization would end up creating, then most of the self aware minds that ever come into existence, are simulated ones.Another argument for this belief is the idea of the Boltzmann brain, which argues that in an infinite multiverse, it should be tremendously more common for particles to randomly assemble into a brain that is having the exact same experience as you are having right now, than for particles to create big bangs.Ancestor simulations is a belief proposed by Nick Bostrom, a professor at Oxford University, he believes that, in the future, it will be possible to simulate the actions of all the neurons in the brain and simulate the sensory input to that brain with enough accuracy to convince the simulation that it is a real person. For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds. There are many articles, videos and interviews on the topic and even people like Neil deGrasse Tyson have backed up this belief.	207.22442520250115
198	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_1571463715-3	Bostrom   points   out   that   the   only   way   we   could   be   sure   is   if   a   message   popped   up    in   front   of   our   eyes   saying:   “You   are    living   in   a   computer   simulation.”  Or,    he   says,   if   the   operators   transported   you   to   their   reality   (which,   of   course,   may   itself   be   a   simulation). Although   we   are   unlikely   to   get   proof,   we   might   find   some   hints   about   our   reality.   “I   think   it   might   be   feasible   to   get   evidence   that   would   at   least   give   weak   clues,”   says   Bostrom. Economist   Robin   Hanson   of   George   Mason   University   in   Fairfax,   Virginia,    is   not   so   sure.	137.76986588467844
199	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	KILT_247365-2	"Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation. For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could ""pop up"" saying: ""You are living in a simulation. Click here for more information."" However, imperfections in a simulated environment might be difficult for the native inhabitants to identify and for purposes of authenticity, even the simulated memory of a blatant revelation might be purged programmatically. Nonetheless, should any evidence come to light, either for or against the skeptical hypothesis, it would radically alter the aforementioned probability.Section::::Arguments.:Computationalism.Computationalism is a philosophy of mind theory stating that cognition is a form of computation. It is relevant to the Simulation hypothesis in that it illustrates how a simulation could contain conscious subjects, as required by a ""virtual people"" simulation. For example, it is well known that physical systems can be simulated to some degree of accuracy."	123.19509137235582
200	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_719719292-4	This principle, when applied to the case of simulation, says that the probability that we are living in a simulated world instead of a real one is equal to the fraction of all people that are actually simulated people.By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case. Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity. So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case. Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation. Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument. However, this isn’t quite accurate.	121.2492731041275
201	137_1-9	Okay, so what do glitches in the simulation prove about our existence in it?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_715074680-1	What is the Multiverse Theory? - Universe Today Posted on November 5, 2010 July 21, 2020 by Matt Williams What is the Multiverse Theory? If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes. The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically. Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy. In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James. However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	235.94167693992492

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in. Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory. For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering. What Is It? The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience. These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously. These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.” What are These Parallel Universes? These parallel universes, also called “braneworlds” by some, hover just beyond your reach.	216.0488169679884
203	137_1-9	Okay, so what do glitches in the simulation prove about our existence in it?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_467976492-2	Well, currently multiverse theory is… just that, a theory.As it stands, the multiverse exists outside our current scientific understanding of reality. Theoretical physics suggests a multiverse is a hypothetical grouping of multiple universes. This means that our Universe could be just one tiny universe in a much larger multiverse where many, possibly even infinite universes, are contained. Interestingly enough, even though much of multiverse theory is hypothetical or imagined, there is some scientific grounding to parts of it. But where to begin? First, not all scientists agree that the multiverse could exist—or that it’s worth exploring. Second, there are actually a few different theories, each which can help to explain certain anomalies in our Universe. (But could also break some currently known things.) Let’s focus on the eternal cosmic inflation theory. This theory starts with the Big Bang. It is suggested that as our Universe expanded into existence, it started off rapidly, then slowed—like when you inflate a balloon. This rapid expansion created our Universe, but also other universes in a vast bubble-like multiverse. While parts of the universe stopped the extremely rapid “inflationary” expansion and “budded off” to become normal space, large parts of the Universe have continued to inflate even now.	159.44808807462687

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_729492685-3	Image via Disney/Marvel That’s where the driving plot of Infinity War comes in, which co-director Joe Russo describes as a heist movie of sorts: “He’s on a hunt.We’re using a bit of a ’90s heist genre component. Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.” So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him. Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power. We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great. This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies. Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	262.4689095690337

MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_99529317-9	Marvel fans — and really, fans in general — are so imaginative they’re often making up their own movies by coming up with “ fan theories .”They like to guess what might happen in a future movie and see if they can be a step or two ahead of the filmmakers. Other times they’re trying to fill in what they perceive as plot holes. Whatever the reasons for their creation, fan theories are sometimes bizarre or even nonsensical — but sometimes, for all their nuttiness, they can be rather brilliant. We found a Ranker list of Marvel theories that are so out there, we actually want many of them to be true. Sometimes they even are. 1. Spider-Man was in ‘Iron Man 2’ Tom Holland | Han Myung-Gu/WireImage This theory sits at the top of the list for a very good reason — it actually turned out to be true. Iron Man 2 was the third MCU movie, and it had a scene where a very young boy encounters a drone and is saved by Tony at the last second. Tom Holland later confirmed that was indeed Peter Parker. What makes this all the more impressive/strange is that Iron Man 2 came out in 2010, when Sony still had full control of the character.	158.4428451048734

It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys. Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence. These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal. [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5. Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make. Teach him about respect and acceptance. Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important. Teach him that value is what matters between friends. The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence. Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends. 6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure. To them looks matter a lot.

Always be very specific when you are giving negative feedback. And make sure your criticism is constructive. Say “Look – this small step in this sum has made the whole answer wrong. Let me explain the step to you again and then do 10 sums like this. That will ensure that you will never make this mistake again.” Do not be grumpy and complaining When teenagers don’t do well in academics – they typically start slipping in other areas of their lives as well. They start keeping their rooms untidy, they neglect their personal hygiene like taking bath and brushing etc. They dress untidily in crushed clothes and so on. This can make you more and more irritated and you may look at your child in disgust whenever she/he is around you and start pointing out everything that is wrong with your child at all times of the day. Do not do this. It can be extremely demotivating. This is the time to support your child and find out why your child is behaving like this with expert help – instead of constantly criticizing her/him.

Teaching social skills is crucial for raising happy, positive and balanced kids. How can you help your child develop better social skills? Your child learns from the way you interact with others so make sure you are a role model for appropriate behavior. This includes greeting people, being a good listener and practicing self-control. Help your youngster develop an active social life by having him join clubs, setting up play dates, etc. Assist him in developing conversation skills. Help him handle difficult behaviors such as teasing and bullying. Social skills worksheets are unique resources designed from the perspective of children aged 3 – 12, to help them develop good communication skills, support kids experiencing social difficulties and encourage them to find their own solutions. No matter how responsible, confident or social your child is, social skills worksheets will help him do even better in life by making him more aware of himself and the people around him.	178.7189812068682

In exchange, he often feels isolated, picked on, and singled out. He struggles with making the connection between socially acceptable behavior and his need for sensory input. My son is not alone. In fact, many times children struggle with these same skills and are pinpointed as a bully, the “mean” kid, non-compliant, or defiant.

Appearance Problem: Girls want to look pretty, and the media has made an almost unattainable idea of beauty. Her body is constantly changing as well, so adjusting to this can make it even more difficult. Solution: Watch your teenager and make sure that she does not suddenly start eating too little or adopting strange diets. Make sure she knows that these looks are just fads, and unhealthy eating habits can affect her for the rest of her life. You should also make sure that she does not hang out with friends who have negative habits involving their appearance. 7. Friendship Problem: While friends can make life worthwhile, they can also cause a lot of stress. An ugly fight with a best friend can leave your daughter in tears. Teenagers are still working to develop their social skills, so many teenage friendships are prone to mood swings and instability. Solution: Let your daughter know that fights are normal.

Help your teen build a healthy and stable foundation for self-worth. Emphasize your values and teach that true self-worth is about living according to those values. Help them see that it’s more important to be kind and caring rather than thin or attractive. 5 ﻿﻿ Balance Freedom with Guidance Micromanaging your teen’s choices will only reinforce that they can’t be trusted to make good decisions independently. It’s important to balance just the right amount of freedom with plenty of guidance. Provide your teen with plenty of opportunities to practice the skills you’ve taught. Let them experience natural consequences and they'll learn from their own mistakes. Over time, they'll develop increased confidence in their ability to make healthy choices. Natural Consequences as an Effective Discipline Tool Help Develop Positive Self-Talk Your teen’s inner monologue will play a major role in how they feel about themselves.	241.587978976866

MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_154714576-3	Furthermore, social media overload may lead to problems with self-esteem, particularly in teenage girls.“Many girls are bombarded with their friends posting the most perfect pictures of themselves, or they’re following celebrities and influencers who do a lot of Photoshopping and have makeup and hair teams,” Dr Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, says in an article for Childmind.org “If that’s their model for what is normal, it can be very hard on their self-confidence.” Another reason why depression is associated with social media might be what psychologists call displacement – which means what teenagers are not doing during time that’s displaced by social media. This includes mental health-boosting activities such as exercise, sleep and developing talents. “If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness,” Dr. Hamlet explains. “Yes, you get a little dopamine burst whenever you get a notification, or a like on a picture, or a follow request. But those things are addicting without being satisfying.” Sleep and low self-esteem One crucial thing that social media can displace is sleep.	194.65425330826383
221	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life.This might also result in inability to empathize. These sites make kids prone to sensationalism. A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall. Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media. A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison. This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence. However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships. Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”. After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody. Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	194.3581066081101
222	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_28_1670194773-3	Low self-esteem is often mistaken as laziness in teens because this tendency toward a lack of positive action when thinking negatively.Negative patterns of thinking often become a habit for teens as they learn to make sense of the adult world. Your teen may quickly develop negative beliefs about themselves or about the world. Creating Healthy Thought Patterns It may be difficult for your teen to notice evidence of positive things in their life. Explaining logically why they should see something in a positive way is not helpful; it may only leave your teen feeling more frustrated or misunderstood. Instead, help train your teen’s own mind to notice the positive. Model noticing the positive things that are already there or that you or your teen is already doing. Show appreciation for your teen’s behavior and model appreciation for things in your life. A common mistake parents make is to tell their teen to “look on the bright side” when their teen just needs to be listened to. When teens feel heard they will often come up with excellent solutions themselves. 3. Experiencing Breakdowns in Communication Difficulty communicating in a positive way with the people around them can be both a cause and a symptom of low self-esteem. Communication breakdowns will distance your teen from you and other helpful adults, as well as from important peer relationships.	120.13775277648892
223	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_1467599711-5	Positive Affirmations Day – Observe a positive affirmation day at your home once a week for your teenager to feel confident and affable.This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem. For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts. Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves. Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually. Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth. Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought. Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again. Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem. The following activity, if practiced regularly, will help your teen reduce the cycle of negative self-talk and make them a more positive person. This activity is divided into four sections.	118.25019006523144

228	139_1-3	Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?	KILT_35509755-2	"1967 saw Newton's most infamous decision: to not promote Louis Armstrong's recording of the song ""What a Wonderful World"". The song had been written with Armstrong in mind, but when Armstrong, who had recently signed with ABC Records, was recording it, Newton tried to stop the recording session, because he disliked the slow pace. Newton was physically locked out of the studio, and the session continued with him fuming outside. Afterward, Newton put no promotion effort into the single, calling it a mistake. ""What a Wonderful World"" did not do well in the U.S. as a result, though it succeeded elsewhere in the world, including hitting #1 in the UK. It remained essentially unknown in the United States until 20 years later, when it gained popularity after being used in the 1987 film ""Good Morning, Vietnam"".In 1970, Newton became vice-president of ABC Pictures."	423.5390632406304
229	139_1-3	Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?	KILT_932074-7	"Thiele's departure was in part precipitated by the breakdown of his relationship with Larry Newton, the president of ABC Records.One of Thiele's last productions was the Louis Armstrong song ""What A Wonderful World"", which Thiele co-wrote and produced for ABC's pop division shortly before Armstrong's death. Although the musicians were apparently unaware of the drama, the recording session is reported to have been the scene of a clash between Thiele and Newton. When Newton arrived at the session he became upset when he discovered that Armstrong was recording a ballad rather than a 'Dixieland'-style number like his earlier hit ""Hello Dolly"". According to Thiele's own account, this led to a screaming match; Newton then had to be locked out of the studio and he stood outside throughout the session, banging on the door and yelling to be let in. The single was released with little promotion from ABC and it sold relatively poorly in the U.S.."	409.07937580783664

The song made Louis Armstrong the oldest male to top the UK Singles Chart. Tom Jones later broke this record in 2009. In 1988, Armstrong's recording appeared in the film Good Morning, Vietnam (despite the film being set in 1965 — two years before it was recorded) and was re-released as a single.

Tran Director : Barry Levinson Motion Picture Rating : R Running Time: 2 hours, 1 minute The film that helped make comedian and actor Robin Williams a household name, Good Morning, Vietnam very loosely chronicles the real-life exploits of Armed Forces Radio Service DJ Adrian Cronauer during the Vietnam War.Rebellious and irreverent, he defies his superiors by playing popular rock music for the troops while simultaneously befriending some of the Vietnamese people his country is at war against. Good Morning, Vietnam introduced an entire generation of moviegoers to Williams' manic energy and humor, and it's still an effective showcase of the late star's incredible talent.

While Good Morning Vietnam has anti-war and anti-American undertones, Cronauer was completely supportive of the war effort. Robin Williams’s comedy is completely different from Adrian Cronauer’s: Cronauer was very reserved in his comedic style and stayed mainly within military guidelines. However, the restaurant bombing incident did occur to a point: while the bombing did occur, and Adrian did notice and bring it up to his boss, he did not go against orders and report the news. I think this movie was , but not great. http://books.google.com/books?id=XcuIse9Mp-QC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=beer+with+formaldehyde+vietnam&source=bl&ots=UbjGftmtyx&sig=z0Pgn3G108GtNr1y1RGlq17Bj1g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fe2CUs_gGKyosATqoICADg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=beer%20with%20formaldehyde%20vietnam&f=false http://1001plus.blogspot.com/2012/02/historical-inaccuracy.html http://www.empireonline.com/features/complete-american-history-in-movies/14.asp http://www.historynet.com/adrian-cronauer-air-force-radio-announcer-in-vietnam.htm http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-10-16/news/0210160283_1_adrian-cronauer-robin-williams-military-journalists http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AGood_Morning,_Vietnam http://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics.html This movie appeals to all audiences, as it has little romance, very few war scenes, and almost no historical consistencies.	205.90180337335917

Williams’ spirited portrayal of a zany disc jockey in Good Morning, Vietnam led to a Golden Globe Award for best actor, an Oscar nomination for best actor and box office success for Hollywood’s first Vietnam War comedy. It also forged a special bond between Williams and the people who had worked at AFVN, a military-run radio and TV operation that broadcast news and entertainment to the troops. I interviewed Williams on the movie set, outside Bangkok, in 1987 for Asia Magazine and “Business Update,” a radio program produced by American Public Radio (now Public Radio International). It was clear that Williams had done his homework.	202.4841422686186

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures. At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe. Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion. The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures. It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time. The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers. Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back. The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO. During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives. It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	288.0093773928347

With a 4000-year-old culture, from palaces and temples to natural wonders, China is home to some of the most impressive landmarks in Asia. It’s a nation that is hurtling towards the future at high speed, with impressive new engineering feats popping up each year. The 500-year-old Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks of Asia and according to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei who orbited in 2003, it can’t be seen from the moon. The structure is a collection of walls, towers, fortresses and barracks stretching 21,196km (13,171 miles). The section of the Great Wall that receives the most visitors are Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing. You can explore this famous landmark in Asia as a day trip from the capital. 2- Angkor Wat Angkkor Wat is a stunning Asian landmark to visit.	196.167677996782

Although there its rich biodiversity has endowed it with plenty of natural attractions, the most famous landmark in this Asian country is a manmade marvel. Standing above the skyline of the nation’s capital, the Petronas Twin Towers is the world’s tallest twin towers (451.8 m). They took six years to build and were designed by César Pelli who created this masterpiece using Islamic concepts and geometric forms, including that of the eight-pointed star. The observation decks on the 86th floor of both towers are connected by a bridge and have stunning views over Kuala Lumpur. 5- Marina Bay Sands Another Asian landmark to see is Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. Although Singapore is rich in colonial history, one of the most stunning architectural landmarks in this country is a contemporary building that dominates the skyline. Marina Bay Sands is a modern ‘ship’ in the sky with amazing views of the island city. Not only is it a landmark in Asia to go and see but you can also stay in it as inside, there’s luxurious accommodation, shopping and stunning infinity pools to.	187.44864955183584
243	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1394706798-5	The restoration and preservation initiatives are being taken up by the government and other non-governmental bodies like the International Friends of the Great Wall and The China Great Wall Society who clean the areas surrounding the most frequently visited areas of the wall and keep a close check on the structural maintenance.Through Western contact with China from the 17th through 20th centuries, the fame of the Great Wall grew and so did tourism. It grew at a whopping rate after President Nixon visited the wall in 1972. Today, a portion of the Great Wall of China, about 80 km from Beijing, is host to about 6 million tourists every year. Many historians have a view that by building a wall of this length, the manpower that went into it, and the deaths reported or assumed during the construction, it would have caused lesser casualties even if another kingdom would have attacked and gotten into a war with China. But from accounts of the Chinese, the wall stands as a representation of their unity and pride. Like it? Share it! « Previous Post Next Post »	162.4046860135859

MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_972701974-6	Walking the Great Wall Today Most people who choose to walk the Great Wall of China today choose to walk either a small portion of it, or pick specific, picturesque spots to do a series of connected hikes.This is because many parts of the wall are very run down, and it’s not possible to walk all the way along the top. In the areas close to Beijing, and other tourist hotspots, the Chinese government has invested a significant amount in the upkeep of the wall, making it a very pleasant, if challenging, hike. The most popular parts of the wall lie near to the capital, including Badaling and Mutianyu. Here you are likely to find the wall crammed with tourists in peak season, making it difficult to walk. However, these sections are particularly well-maintained, and set among glorious scenery, with views over the forest. For a day trek, the section between Jinshanling and Simatai is very popular. This section only attracts tour groups at Jinshanling, and once you set off, you’re likely to meet very few people along the way. The wall is crumbling and broken down in places, but remains accessible, and this 11km hike takes you through some of the region’s finest scenery.	138.27303416188806
245	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander.Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places. In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders. In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea). The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire. Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier. It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads. Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world. In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	134.25375726172933

It is located the Northern Indian city of Agra, in the southern bank of Yamuna river in India, and its architecture is one of the most significant examples of Mughal architecture style. The complex also houses a mosque and guest house. Made of white marble from Makrana, in Rajasthan, the Taj Mahal combines a range of architectural styles, such as Islamic, Persian and Indian styles. For the construction, other noble materials were used, such as turquoise from Tibet, jade and crystal from China, sapphire from Sri Lanka and Arabia and lapis lazuli from Afghanistan. To get to Taj Mahal, you can take a train from Delhi (there are more than 20 trains a day), a bus, or a taxi. Admission to the Taj Mahal starts from Rs. 300 /- for foreigners.	97.3726083021611

Happy holidays! Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well! My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such. It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another. So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities. I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing. The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights. Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	222.12140839775384

255	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_msmarco_doc_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization.The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan. The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari. Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute. Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well. Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders. This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details. The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	171.83588448888077

Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza. All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time. The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq. The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters. So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.

There was, first, the romantic idea of honest  expression: that a building should be faithful in revealing its  materials and structure, as Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc  (1814–1879) had argued, without any classical ornament or fake  surface or structure. There was, second, the idea that a  building's form should reflect its plan, its functional  arrangement of interior spaces, as Henry Latrobe and Horatio Greenough  had proposed. There was, third, the belief that each building should  express something new and distinctive in the times (G. W. F. Hegel   [ 1770–1831], Gottfried Semper [ 1803–1879]) and  specifically the new technical resources, such as steel skeletons and electric light and elevators, which suggested  skyscrapers and new forms of building (John Wellborn Root).

Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"". Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century. The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity. — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"".

This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called ""the best all-time work of American architecture.""

Fufu is a staple Nigerian food, and it can be eaten with any soup, (that has a lot of assorted meat). However, it takes many hours of strenuous work to prepare. The nutritional value and health benefits of fufu are: 1. It is also very rich in carbohydrates and can supply the body a lot of energy. 2. It is very low in cholesterol. 3. It contains a lot of potassium. Health Risks Just two wraps of fufu contain more than 600 calories. That can make you very fat. Fufu has a glycemic index of 84. It is one of the leading causes of belly fat. So now we have evaluated both of them. This is the moment you have been waiting for. Between fufu and Garri, the most healthy food is… Fufu!

Injury to tuber releases linamarase enzyme from the ruptured cells, which then converts linamarin to poisonous hydrocyanic acid (HCN). Therefore, consumption of raw cassava root results in cyanide poisoning with symptoms of vomiting, nausea, dizziness, stomach pains, headache, and death. In general, cyanide content is substantially higher in its outer part and peel. While peeling lessens the cyanide content, sun drying, and soaking followed by boiling in salt-vinegar water results in evaporation of this compound and makes it safe for human consumption. Prolong use of monotonous cassava diet may lead to chronic illness like tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) and Diabetes, especially among rural and tribal inhabitants who purely engaged in processing and consumption of cassava products.

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish. No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof. The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights. A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal. Thank God we know better.

Archeological artifacts have been discovered in Senegal and the Gambia, such as pre-historic pottery, the 8th century stones, and 14th century burial mounds, but, states Gamble, these provide no evidence that link them exclusively to the Wolof ethnic group. Their name as the Wolof first appears in the records of 15th century Portuguese travelers.With the Arab conquests of West Africa in last centuries of the 1st millennium CE, one theory states that the Wolof people were forced to move into north and east Senegal where over time villages developed into autonomous states such as Baol, Kayor, Saloum, Dimar, Walo and Sine the overall ruling state being that of Jolof who came together voluntarily to form the Jolof Empire.	316.94745804549984

MARCO_msmarco_doc_02_420075955-1	Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital. Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s. A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time. The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return. This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return. Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme. How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example. Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month. The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month. The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest. This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.	229.96462257283565

In 2006, it was discovered that Pearlman was the head of one of the largest and longest running Ponzi schemes in American history, leaving almost half a billion dollars in debts.

Madoff was eventually caught and sentenced to 150 years in prison, but not before pulling of what is essentially the biggest con game of all time. Other Articles you Might Like Liked it?

Spotting Ponzi schemes Common types of Ponzi scheme operate under a variety of names including “high yield investment program” and “high yield debentures”. Their common characteristics are very high returns with no clear underlying business to generate them. More complex forms of Ponzi scheme can be harder to detect. They may well appear to be legitimate investments. They may even be part of an investment that includes both legitimate and Ponzi elements. An example of the latter is an investment or finance company that offers very high returns to depositors, and does lend the money (as a real finance company would) to make returns, but does so knowing that the return on loans will not suffice to cover the interest paid to depositors. Returns that are too consistent are also a reason for suspicion. This was a characteristic of the fraudulent fund run by Bernard Madoff.	121.2055149882217
333	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_18_1642035430-6	"Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme Theoretically it is not impossible at least for certain entities operating as Ponzi scheme to ultimately ""succeed"" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate.For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment. Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ). Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse. Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	167.9700575026509

Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release. Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds. In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.

However, pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money to the top of the pyramid. They fail simply because there are not sufficient people. Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of ""Robbing Peter to pay Paul""—early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, a scheme such as the Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998) in India can be called a Ponzi scheme. Some Ponzi schemes can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two."	154.66236813785508

A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.BULLET::::- Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant. Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme)."	134.5832305913791

KILT_47185-0	"Ponzi schemeA Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors. The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds. A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit""."	119.91707427008078

348	141_1-3	What else about scams should I be aware of asides from guaranteed returns?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_37_252078987-7	The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office warns that card services scammers will offer to help reduce a credit card holder’s interest rate, and often charge upfront fees of $2,000 or more.These companies then often fail to deliver on their promises, and the cardholder is out the thousands of dollars they paid upfront. At other times the scammers will pretend they work for a credit card issuer and they ask the cardholder to “verify” their bank information so they can help reduce the consumer’s interest rate, the Minnesota attorney general warns. Or they will pressure cardholders to disclose their financial information so they can ostensibly take advantage of a “limited time” interest rate reduction. Instead, the fraudsters will use that information to commit identity theft. “It’s a huge red flag” if someone who purports to be from your bank is trying to pressure you to provide your personal or financial information or make a snap decision, Casey-Velasquez says. A bank or credit card issuer won’t apply pressure because they want to retain you as their customer. If you think a call is suspicious, Breyault recommends hanging up the phone and calling the bank yourself, either using the telephone number on the back of your credit card, or by looking the phone number up online.	229.55941163363968

MARCO_msmarco_doc_40_221671898-2	"These scammers use a variety of tactics to get your credit or debit card number and as much personal information as possible.Their goal is a quick payoff by running up purchases or cash advances on your accounts or selling the information to other fraudsters. One of the most common scams is an offer of low interest rates or a chance to reduce your debt for a nominal fee up front. Another approach is to call or text fake fraud alerts that appear to be from your credit card company. Many consumers complain about receiving these calls multiple times a day, even if they don't have a credit card. Such calls almost always begin with the caller asking you to ""verify"" your account information. Remember that the scammer's goal is identity theft, and statistics show that any engagement with a scam caller exponentially increases the likelihood that you will become a victim. To help you avoid credit card phone scams, follow these tips: If you receive an unsolicited or automated call from a company offering to lower your interest rate, don't hang on, hang up. Never provide or confirm personal or financial information during any call that you didn't initiate. Never respond to ""yes or no"" questions or push any phone buttons if prompted to opt-out of future calls."	147.47977024075954

Block them so that they will be unable to keep reaching out to you, and don’t give them warning before you do it. If you ever feel unsafe while talking to someone online, the best thing to do is to just get out of that situation as quickly as possible. Not all scammers can easily be outsmarted, so don’t get discouraged if you just have to leave the situation.

When first talking to someone new online, do not give out too much personal information and always keep an eye out for anything suspicious.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_27_1237635519-4	Don’t show emotion We’re not suggesting having a friendly chat with the scam company but rather to communicate to the scammers in an emotionless way that you intend on and have already begun pursuing them using legal means.If you’ve already sent them angry emails or yelled at them over the phone, no matter. Go ahead and start over with a different tone and go through the process in a competent and professional manner. It’s important that you don’t show very much emotion or anger because this tends to make the scammers feel as though you are out of control because you know that there’s nothing that you can do. You want to avoid using expletives as angry as you might be. This only encourages the scammers to ignore you. In addition to communicating via any available channel you have used up until now. If there is any sort of mailing address, send a lawyers letter (in addition to emailing them) to the trading platform that took your Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency telling them that you have already reported them to the financial authorities and you will be pursuing them legally. While this doesn’t guarantee by any means that they will give you your bitcoin back, this has been reported to work in some cases, especially when followed up by appropriate action.	164.3944085353287

If you cannot find a guarantor, you may be required to make all rental payments in advance. This can be risky and expensive. Always ensure that you have access to cash and small change. The majority of places will only accept cash payment, and there is a distinct lack of small change throughout Argentina; if you do not have coins in your possession, you may not be able to board the bus or pay for a taxi. If you are a foreigner, you are expected to pay cash in full for purchasing real estate. Expatriates who generate an income abroad are not required to pay tax when they transfer the funds into Argentina. Many employers will tell you that you do not need a work visa to work for them. This is untrue. Legally employers are required to register you as an employee but fail to do so because it incurs additional costs for the company in tax and social security.	250.0356678697281

So we thought we'd dig up 10 interesting facts you didn’t know about Argentina, curious bits of information that don't usually get a mention in your average Argentina travel guide: 1. Invented Radio Broadcasting Argentina was one of the first countries in the world to have radio broadcasting. The country’s first broadcast was made in August 1920. At that time only 20 people had a receiver! One of the first radio ads. 2 . Two female presidents The Ex President, and actual Argentinian vice President, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, was the first woman President to be officially elected in Argentina. However she isn’t the first female president to ever rule over Argentina. Isabél Perón - who was the vice president to her husband Juan Domingo Perón – stood in as Argentina’s first female president for two years, after her husband’s sudden death in 1974.

While delicious, it was really sweet for breakfast. Medialunas for breakfast in Argentina After two months in Argentina, I’ve gotten used to supplementing my hostel breakfast with fruit or yogurt to satiate my American desire for something more substantial. I especially missed protein in the morning. However, you won’t find eggs or meat as part of an authentic Argentine breakfast. When you are served something aside from the typical staples of coffee and either tostadas or medialunas, it’s because they are gratifying tourists. It’s not just in cafes where I’ve found the Argentine breakfast a bit lacking. We’ve eaten at enough breakfast-included Argentine accommodations to know it’s universal.	441.44084642730206

Buenos Aires, Argentina. The capital of Argentina is Buenos Aires, which is located along the southeastern shore of South America, along the Rio de la Plata. This city has a population size of 3.89 million and a metropolitan population of around 17 million, making it the largest city in the country and fourth-largest city in the western hemisphere. This city is known for its high quality of life. For example, residents of Buenos Aires have one of the highest household income levels in South America. Additionally, this capital city is is popular with tourists, who come to take in the multicultural scene and European-influenced architecture. History of the Capital of Argentina Present-day Buenos Aires was inhabited by indigenous peoples until Spanish explorers founded the city in 1536. The native inhabitants defended their homes and forced the European settlers out of the region by 1542. Nearly 40 years later, Spanish colonizers returned and established a trading post.

Argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture, as the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land. Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income. By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest state per capita. Beginning in the 1930s, however, the Argentine economy deteriorated notably. The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government."	163.68517734145144

In April 1671 he was commissioned to organise a party for the Duc de Condé, owner of Chantilly, and his cousin Louis XIV at the Chateau. The party lasted from 23 to 25 April, sumptuous meals were served, illuminations, hunting and lavish entertainment were organised. For the famed Vatel however, things did not go so well. There were problems in the kitchen and with supplies and it is said that unable to bear the indignity of failure, Vatel committed suicide before the party was over. Legend has it that one of the problems was the non delivery of cream for the dishes Vatel had planned. In order to give volume to the cream supplies he had, Vatel created Chantilly cream. But – that is not true, it is a myth say historians. The recipe for whipped frothy cream goes back much further.	313.3564931016135

Their soccer supporters have a special name, hinchas, but whether it be a sport match or a musical concert they will always react with tremendous enthusiasm and great gratitude. They even sing entire songs (not just verses!) in the stadiums and change the lyrics into actual chants fit for the occasion. Even when their team is losing they will keep on singing. Other countries started copying this trend. * Megadeth went to say that they always enjoyed playing in Argentina because of the audience reception there, they even recorded a DVD to show it to the rest of their fans, and the world. AC/DC recorded an entire DVD in the River Plate stadium, and Ramones were chased around in the streets of Buenos Aires by obsessive fans. The band even choose the country for their final international concert. There’s a local proverb that says “Hinchada hay una sola: hinchada de Argentina, las demás no tienen bola”. * Apart from soccer icons Argentinia also had its fair share of other universally admired, yet controversial heroes, like Che Guevara and Evita Peron.	204.20887879871952

Don’t expect police to stop you driving through a red light, or give you a fine for riding your bike on the pavement. There are no security cameras around the cities like in London, and rules exist in theory only. There is a great freedom in Argentina that has been lost in much of the rest of the world, but of course this also comes with its drawbacks, in that often the country doesn’t run very efficiently. But nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice! Many people come to Argentina and stay because of the great climate. Winters are mild, with temperatures rarely falling below about 5 degrees celsius, and summers are hot and lengthy. There is also something very satisfying about spending summer in the southern hemisphere when everyone in the northern hemisphere is having to struggle through January! A definite benefit to living in Argentina. Argentina is a hotbed of culture, both independent and institutional. It has produced some of Latin America’s most important writers, has a thriving film and theatre scene and a hugely diverse artistic culture.	188.25458492154823

MARCO_msmarco_doc_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners.In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real. This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers. Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell. All this led to a sharp reduction in exports. As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998. Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy. In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket. Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime. As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	226.4747058392968

Two in particular are worth mentioning. First, Salta. Up           in the hot north, these are the world’s highest commercial           vineyards: were it not for the effect of altitude, it would be too hot           for quality viticulture here. Second, Patagonia. Travelling far south,           this is a cooler, windier, flatter region that’s beginning to turn           out some really nice wines. This tasting covered 45 different Malbecs, which sounds           like a lot, but is only a quick sampling of a much broader offering. Some important wines are missing – Catena, Achaval Ferrer and Colomé,           to name but three – and so this can’t be seen as a true ranking of           Argentina’s best. In terms of quality, I though this was quite high           across the board. Remember, this is a mixture of commercial wines and           then some high-end ones. Stylistically, I think Argentina would do           well to go down the road of freshness, definition and structure,           rather than super-ripeness and new oak flavours.	205.30106984827216

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_1691423019-3	“At a tasting in 1995,” he says, “I remember a British journalist telling me, ‘Let’s not waste our time tasting the white wines,’ and moving swiftly to the red wines, because he thought Argentina wasn’t capable of making good white wine.Years later, once I got over being angry at what he said, I realized he was right. Our white wines oxidized shortly after being bottled.” The international market’s lackluster response to Argentina’s white wines at the time was in stark contrast to its growing enthusiasm for the country’s red wines, and as Malbec production boomed, there was a sharp decline in Argentina’s white wine production. In the 1990s red varieties, such as Malbec, made up less than 20 percent of vineyard plantings, while white varieties made up 30 percent and pink varieties (such as Cereza, typically used for white wines, pink and light red wines, and juice) accounted for 50 percent, according to Argentina’s Institute of National Viticulture and Viniculture. Within two decades, the vineyard landscape had changed.	192.52400132828188

If you want to visit any other attractions in the area, such as the Itaipú Dam or Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, factor in an additional day for that. How to Get to Iguazu Falls You have three options for visiting the falls: (1) tour Iguazu falls on your own by public transport; (2) go on an all-inclusive tour of Iguazu falls; or (3) take private transportation, but without a tour guide. In my view, Iguazu tours are completely unnecessary and take all the fun out of exploring the falls on your own. Large tour groups also clog up the pathways and can ruin the experience for other visitors, so I do not recommend this option. If you’re staying in Foz do Iguaçu, it’s easy to reach the Brazilian side of the falls by taking the No. 120 public bus, which runs between the city, the airport and the falls. Tickets cost less than four reais.	154.34907369641587

It is on the expensive side, but it is the only hotel in the National Park and by staying here, you have access to the trails along the falls and the catwalk leading into the horseshoe at sunrise and sunset. 12. Iguazu Falls From Restaurant Footpath Things to do in Iguassu Falls There is an excellent viewing point at the main restaurant where you can see them from above, plus take an elevator or footpath down to the catwalk to see them up close. Iguassu National Park opens at 8:00 am and closes at 5pm, so if you are not staying at the hotel, you have no chance of witnessing sunrise or sunset over the falls. We were out at the crack of dawn and until after dusk exploring Iguassu Falls virtually on our own. We only saw one or two other people at the falls so we were free to photograph and explore in solitude. It was an incredible experience.	128.43136996484827

Merienda is important to the Filipinos because they find the gap between lunch and  dinner too long, and they need to take many breaks from the intense  tropical heat. Lumpia (spring rolls), puto (little cupcakes made from ground rice), and panyo-panyo (tiny pastry envelopes filled with mango and banana jam) are a few merienda dishes. Anything can be served with the snack except steamed rice.  Steamed rice constitutes a complete meal, which merienda is not considered. 6 POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND NUTRITION About 22 percent of the population of the Philippines are classified as  undernourished by the World Bank. This means they do not receive adequate  nutrition in their diet. Of children under the age of five, about 30  percent are underweight, and nearly one-third are stunted (short for their age).	236.10860174045135

Dinner in Spain is lighter than la comida but can also consist of multiple courses. Traditionally, la cena takes places around 10:00pm. With schedules evolving, some people have begun to have a merienda-cena, which just means they have a final meal at an earlier time rather than an evening snack and then dinner. Still, if you go out to eat around 8:30pm, when restaurants open for dinner, even popular places will be practically empty. Although replacing dinner with a merienda-cena is not typical, it is an economical option that gives your body some extra time to digest your food before going to bed.

It is made using leaves and twigs from the yerba mate plant, a holly-like shrub, which are steeped in hot water to make mate or cold water to make tereré. In the romantic mind, the word ""mate"" (rhymes with ""latte"") may evoke a pastoral image of gauchos sitting around a campfire on the vast plains of the Pampas, passing the traditional gourd between them, but today drinking mate is a normal part of everyday life for urbanites and small-town folks alike. In fact, mate is so popular that it is the national drink of both Argentina and Paraguay. Drinking mate has numerous health benefits for both body and mind.

El mate es una bebida deliciosa y nutritiva que proviene de las hojas de Ilex Paraguariensis, árbol que sólo crece en la región subtropical de América del Sur. ¿De dónde viene el mate? El mate es una bebida de Sudamérica a base de hojas de yerba mate, sumamente popular en Argentina, Brasil, Uruguay y Paraguay. Para entender su importancia actual, es necesario conocer su historia. La yerba de los guaraníes El consumo de mate se remonta al pueblo guaraní (indígenas nativos de algunos países de Sudamérica), según confirmaron las investigaciones del ensayista Amaro Villanueva. Los guaraníes masticaban directamente las hojas o las colocaban en una calabaza con agua y sorbían. De hecho, la palabra “mate” viene del guaraní “Caa-mate” (“Caa” sería planta o hierba, y “mate” se refiere a la calabaza, el recipiente donde la bebían). Otros pueblos como los incas, los charrúas y aún los araucanos adoptaron la costumbre del mate gracias a trueques con los guaraníes. Para los indígenas, el árbol de mate era un regalo sagrado de los dioses, y de hecho el mate tenía para ellos un significado especial y espiritual, además de sus propiedades y valor nutritivo.	143.90991726517677

This is known in Spanish as mate cocido or cocido. In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of merienda (roughly, afternoon tea), often with a selection of facturas (sweet pastries). It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools. Cultivation Yerba mate The plant is grown mainly in South America, more specifically in Northern Argentina ( Corrientes, Misiones ), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil ( Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná ). The Guaraní are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant; the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries, who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador. When the yerba is harvested, the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor. Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up.	142.7991613221286

MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_937745370-10	Old World European customs mix with New World Latin American traditions to form a cultural heritage unique to Argentina.This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found. With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city. Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities. The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land. Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country. The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs. These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world. The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango. An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay. From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	176.5038695213152

The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity. The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy. The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires. A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin. Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration. Population and wealth are unequally  distributed. As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	149.67846061242744

'En Argentina, se baila el tango. ' Literally, this is saying, 'In Argentina, the tango dances itself.' In English, you could say, 'In Argentina, the tango is danced,' but you'd be most likely to say, 'In Argentina, they dance the tango.' 'Se construyeron las casas. ' Again, literally, 'The houses built themselves,' but it sounds much better to say either, 'The houses were built,' or, 'They built the houses.' 'Se puede ver el mar desde aquí. ' 'The ocean can be seen from here,' or, 'You can see the ocean from here.' OK, now let's take some impersonal and passive sentences in English and see how you would translate them into Spanish using the impersonal se. ' The dishes were washed.' To say this in Spanish, we would start with se, then add the correct form of the verb lavar. What was washed? The dishes, so the verb will need to be in the third person plural form.	194.227283766013

It is actually an artistic expression that can take many forms: instrumental, vocal, dance, or any combination thereof. Invariably, the tango is a narrative–a melancholy, bittersweet expression of love and passion…an art form that has evolved over many decades. Here, the sexy dance was used to draw in the customers. Even today, the between-leg movements of the tango are somewhat risqué; but in times past, they were beyond the pale. Today, tango clubs abound in both La Boca and San Telmo, and a night spent in one is an experience you will not soon forget. One of the most popular is Señor Tango, where a 12-piece orchestra and a large company of singers and dancers treat audiences to a century of tango styles.	173.31380013112357

Open banking is a concept in financial services based on several principles: the use of open APIs allowing third party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions, increased financial transparency options for account holders and the use of open source technology to achieve these principles. Using APIs means that banking data will be available in real-time, providing consumers with better ways to conduct transactions, save and invest their money. Consumers may also have access to better loan terms since lenders will be able to look at historical transactional data to determine a borrower’s risk level. Open Banking also aims to give consumers better and more personalized information for making sound financial decisions. Around the world there are pressures, both regulatory and customer-led, that are opening up the financial services market to new entrants and disrupting what and how customers buy. In Europe, the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is set to unleash a transformation in how financial services organizations view themselves and each other. In the United States, aggregators such as Mint.com have already dis-intermediated banks and now own the ‘last mile’ of the customer banking relationship, disrupting traditional players.	192.3636122511089

MARCO_msmarco_doc_46_393414303-17	· The introduction and implementation of both Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD2) and the Open API standards and data sharing remedy from the UK Competition and Markets Authority following its Retail Banking Market Investigation Order (together 'Open Banking') from January 2018 with delivery across 2019 provides third parties and banks with opportunities to change and enhance the relationship between a customer and their bank.It does this by providing customers with the ability to share their transactional data with authorised third-party service providers either for aggregation or payment services. It is anticipated that both aggregation and payment services will be offered by third parties to Barclay Group's customers and Barclays Group itself has launched an aggregation service. PSD2 will also introduce new requirements to the authentication process for a number of actions customers take, including ecommerce transactions. A failure to comply with Open Banking requirements could expose Barclays Group to regulatory sanction. Further, the data sharing regime could mean that actions or omissions by third-party service providers could expose Barclays Group to potential financial loss from third-party fraud, misuse of customer data, litigation and reputational detriment, amongst other things. The changes to authentication may change the fraud environment across the industry as providers implement different approaches to comply.	199.3393166231508

Early “open banking” projects were scraping data from shared sources, but the records were often incomplete and provided only a partial picture. These projects were difficult and expensive to support: If a bank decided to redesign its application, scraping became impossible. Open banking APIs solve that problem by providing access to standardized data in a secure manner. Payment Services Directive Explained So, what is PSD2? The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a legal framework that regulates payment services through the EU and EEA (European Economic Area). The directive supports innovation and development of an integrated payment market across Europe. The new regulatory document was adopted in October 2015. It was a logical extension of the original PSD, which was designed in 2007 to increase competition across the payment industry. The new directive is focused on making cross-border payments easy and secure. PSD2 integrates open banking and APIs with the financial business industry ecosystem.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-17	US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services.Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers’ financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements. How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well. By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength. However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States. Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice? Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8). Going “all-in” may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks.	422.3576864007997
418	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-3	Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches.Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking. However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs. If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals. Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models. So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed. Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation. This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives. But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data. This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking. The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.	421.5220180963988
419	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-7	Practitioners around the globe frequently use ”open banking” as an umbrella term that encompasses both open banking and platform banking.But we believe there are important differences. Open banking is when a bank, upon a customer’s request, shares customer data with third parties via APIs. 6 Open banking does not use other, less secure methods of data-sharing, such as screen scraping, CSV files, or OCR-readable statements. There are two types of open APIs: read access, which only gives access to account information, or write access, which enables payments. 7 Open banking can be mandated through government regulations, as it is in the United Kingdom and the European Union Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), or its adoption can be industry-driven, as is the case now in the United States. 8 Open banking is built upon the premise that customers own the data they generate and have the right to direct banks to share their data with others they trust. While it was designed to give customers more choice, open banking may end up making customers better understand and appreciate the value of one of their key assets: their data.	390.49946011445377
420	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	KILT_21954995-0	Financial innovationFinancial innovation is the act of creating new financial instruments as well as new financial technologies, institutions, and markets. Recent financial innovations include hedge funds, private equity, weather derivatives, retail-structured products, exchange-traded funds, multi-family offices, and Islamic bonds (Sukuk). The shadow banking system has spawned an array of financial innovations including mortgage-backed securities products and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).There are 3 categories of innovation: institutional, product, and process. Institutional innovations relate to the creation of new types of financial firms such as specialist credit card firms like Capital One, electronic trading platforms such as Charles Schwab Corporation, and direct banks. Product innovation relates to new products such as derivatives, securitization, and foreign currency mortgages. Process innovations relate to new ways of doing financial business, including online banking and telephone banking.	210.66055679376583
421	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_419159361-14	This not only suggests to organizations that there is little revenue potential, but it also mean that it would be expensive to develop such a market.Consequently, relatively few organizations invest in and experiment with new products based on the new technology brought about through technological discontinuity. For example, When Amazon started selling books online Barnes and Nobles and other brick and mortar booksellers discounted the new technology model and now Barnes and Nobles may be on the brink of bankruptcy. Barnes and Nobles, Borders and other bookseller also believe that not many books will want to buy books online. How can you buy what you have not seen? The banking industry is also another example. Although on-line technology has existed for some time, until recently on-line product innovation in the banking industry has been slow in coming. One cause has been the difficulty in adapting banking to on-line technology. Banks have to develop user software application, terminal equipment, and sophisticated communications facilities to mesh the technology into a product that consumers could easily use and also be able to have enough security built into the applications to protect users and bank’s asset. Banks probably also believed that consumers would want personal contact with a human banker, due to the relative complexity and risk associated with financial products.	162.6003998866072

It can be tempting to choose more than one, but the best brands are laser-focused on one type of value. There are three primary types of value: Product/Service Excellence - You offer the best products and services because your focus is innovation and thought leadership. Operational Excellence - You can deliver your product/service at a lower cost than your competitors. Perhaps due to better manufacturing processes or streamlined systems. Relationship Excellence - You solve your customers' problems. You’re selling a relationship with customized solutions that meet their specific needs. For example, Coca-Cola’s value proposition is a product/service of excellence. Coca-Cola places the needs of the customer first, standing on the pillars of quality, diversity, sustainability, and growth on a global scale. Step 2 - Clarify Your Brand Pillars We’ve established that a brand is an experience. Experiences are shaped by emotion. By defining your brand’s benefits, you can zero in on how your brand creates an emotional impact.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2335571310-89	Now what Bolliger is right, of course.The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which adds to the market uncertainty. Investing everything in a single cryptocurrency is a very bad idea, because a better version really could replace bitcoin at the top of the heap. I'm not saying that this will happen but the risk is not zero percent. If you're investing in cryptocurrencies today, it's probably best to divide your holdings between bitcoin and a few other respectable names such as Ethereum and Litecoin. All the major names happen to be falling today, but their performance can vary widely from time to time. Don't cry for the bitcoin specialists, though. With the exception of the micro-cap Ebang International, all of them have performed extremely well during the current bitcoin boom. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust gained 347% over the last 52 weeks and MicroStrategy rose 331% over the same period. CleanSpark's stock posted a 614% gain. And if you thought those results were impressive, we haven't even talked about Riot Blockchain's 1,964% return or Marathon's crushing 2,374% gains. All of that is after going through Friday's significant haircuts. John Young , Co-founder, CEO at Cryptosheets (2017-present)	217.9245400554892

India India, once viewed as a burgeoning, friendly environment for cryptocurrencies, has been clamping down on cryptocurrencies in 2018. India’s tough stance stems from similar concerns that other, more stringent regulatory regimes have cited: money laundering, illegal activity proliferation, sponsorship of terrorism, tax evasion, etc. While the cash-reliant country is facing stern regulations, participants of the local cryptocurrency industry do not believe India can “ban” cryptocurrencies through regulations in the same way China has. Australia In the wake of the August 2017 financial scandal surrounding the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Australian government sought to follow in Japan’s footsteps by strengthening its anti-money laundering laws and regulating digital currencies.	189.1471408812104

The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions. Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.” The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [ cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.” While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	155.41933843959123

MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_189965382-4	There have been a number of high-profile cryptocurrency hacks and heists that have resulted in millions of dollars being stolen.Traders and investors have lost funds and some platforms have ceased to operate. In the aftermath of these hacks, the price of particular cryptocurrencies has dropped considerably. In a bid to counter the activities of these cybercriminals, traders and platform operators have to take a number of precautionary measures. While some of these measures are indeed helpful, they create bottlenecks that hamper the cryptocurrency trading process. This then creates a trade-off between security and efficiency. Take for instance, the need to provide adequate security for cryptocurrency held in wallet storage. Due to the activities of hackers, some traders prefer to store the bulk of their cryptocurrency holdings in offline wallets. This means that anytime they wish to trade, they have to move from offline storage to online storage before participating in the trade. This constitutes another hassle in an already convoluted trading environment. Transactions on a blockchain are immutable and as such if funds get stolen, there is little chance of ever recovering such funds. Cryptocurrency trading platforms constantly have to improve their security framework in order to stay ahead of the hackers and thieves.	152.10802847740706

MARCO_msmarco_doc_39_1627914751-2	This one is new, but the two side boosters for this launch have flown before.It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch. The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets. Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing. However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult. The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first. Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage. Falcon Heavy at the Cape pic.twitter.com/hizfDVsU7X — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2017 Based on Musk’s photos, all the rocket is missing is the payload. SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board. Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking. Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though. The Falcon heavy launch is currently scheduled for some time in January, which is not an optimal Mars transfer timeframe, by the way.	159.25983606107184

KILT_4348888-3	A first design of the Falcon Heavy included a unique propellant crossfeed capability, where fuel and oxidizer to power most of the engines on the center core would be fed from the two side cores, up until the side cores would be near empty and ready for the first separation event. However, due to its extreme complexity this feature was cancelled in 2015 leaving each of the three cores to burn its own fuel.Like the single stick Falcon 9, each Falcon Heavy booster core is reusable. The Falcon Heavy Test Flight demonstrated the two side boosters landing simultaneously near their launch site, while the central booster attempted a landing on SpaceX's Autonomous spaceport drone ship, which resulted in a hard landing near the ship. During the second mission all three boosters landed softly. A Falcon Heavy launch that succeeds in recovering all three core boosters has the same material expenditure as the Falcon 9, i.e. the upper stage and potentially the payload fairing.	142.3052347570192

The April 2013 draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed SpaceX South Texas Launch Site includes specific accommodations for return of the Falcon 9 first-stage boosters to the launch site. Elon Musk first publicly referred to the reusable Falcon 9 as the Falcon 9-R in April 2013.In September 2013, SpaceX successfully relit three engines of a spent booster on an orbital launch, and the booster re-entered the atmosphere at hypersonic speed without burning up. With the data collected from the first flight test of a booster-controlled descent from high altitude, coupled with the technological advancements made on the Grasshopper low-altitude landing demonstrator, SpaceX announced it believed it was ready to test a full land-recovery of a booster stage.	157.45336737763137

The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster. These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015. SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters. Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	151.77831425517795

453	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine. Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine. No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel. The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel. Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets. But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor. So why does SpaceX use Methane? It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX has developed the Raptor. It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine. The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket. No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets. SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket. The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	189.9336762863677

SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel. However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant. So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene? SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines. And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature. It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets. When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars. However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable. So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	148.98438530950807

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_3581880174-11	Methane In November 2012, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced plans to develop liquid methane /LOX rocket engines.It had previously used only RP-1 /LOX in SpaceX rocket engines. As of March 2014 [ update] , SpaceX was developing the Raptor methalox bipropellant rocket engine, which by 2016 was predicted to generate 3,000 kN (670,000 lbf) of thrust. The engine is slated to be used on a future super-heavy rocket, the Starship. Although it has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen, liquid methane can be produced on Mars via the Sabatier reaction and is easier to store than liquid hydrogen due to its higher boiling point and density, as well as its lack of hydrogen embrittlement. It also leaves less residue in the engines compared to kerosene, which is beneficial for reusability. In July 2014, Firefly Space Systems announced their plans to use methane fuel for their small satellite launch vehicle, Firefly Alpha with an aerospike engine design. In September 2014, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance announced the joint development of the BE-4 LOX/LNG engine. The BE-4 will provide 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) of thrust.

In addition, jet engines running on hydrogen are quite easy to build—the first ever turbojet was run on hydrogen. Also, although not duct engines, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines have seen extensive use.However, in almost every other way, hydrogen is problematic. The downside of hydrogen is its density; in gaseous form the tanks are impractical for flight, but even in the form of liquid hydrogen it has a density one fourteenth that of water. It is also deeply cryogenic and requires very significant insulation that precludes it being stored in wings. The overall vehicle would end up being very large, and difficult for most airports to accommodate. Finally, pure hydrogen is not found in nature, and must be manufactured either via steam reforming or expensive electrolysis.	329.1021247724111

Pre-ignition leads to harmful flashbacks into the carburetor and rough operation and is believed to be due to the development of surface ""hot spots."" Induction ignition can occur due to excessive temperatures of both combustion chamber components and small surface deposits or suspended particles. Hydrogen's exceptionally low ignition energy requires that the average temperature prevailing within the combustion space during induction be sufficiently low so that the formation of hot spots is avoided. This requires appropriate cooling of the cylinder head, piston, valves, combustion chamber wall, and the use of cold spark plugs (non-platinum tipped spark plugs). One way to reduce the effect of combustion chamber hot spots on the pre-ignition of a fresh charge is to use thermal dilution techniques. The unusual heat and mass transfer characteristics of hydrogen make it almost necessary to rethink the combustion chamber and cooling system design so that hydrogen's unique attributes can be capitalized on to full advantage. Another important issue regarding the engine operation, especially with near stoichiometric hydrogen and air mixtures, is the extent of NOx formation."	209.22900421764643

It weighs approximately 4.6 ounces while the propellant weighs approximately 2.2 ounces. Even though it is not considered a high power model rocket engine, it could launch a rocket like the Apogee Aspire, which is built for altitude, well over 4,000 feet into the air. When Engine Size Doesn’t Matter In general, a larger and heavier motor will be more powerful because there will be more fuel inside of it, but this is not always true. There are two different types of model rocket engines commonly used to launch model rockets of all kinds. The model rocket engine most people are familiar with is the black powder engines, which were the first model rocket engines sold widely. Since the 1980s another model rocket engine has been gaining in popularity, especially for high power model rocketry, and that is the composite engine. One of the most important differences between these two types of engines is that the fuel in composite engines offers more power in smaller packages than the fuel in black powder engines.	150.25705988629488

471	144_3-1	Are RD-270 and SpaceX Raptor rocket engines the same? How do they compare roughly?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_52_1054170063-4	"This ""total impulse"" or total rocket power combines the rocket engine's average thrust with the amount of time that it burns.If two rocket engines have the same average thrust, but one burns for twice as long as the other, the longer-burning engine would have twice the total power as the one which burns for less time, even though each had the same average thrust. This average thrust of an Estes rocket engine is indicated by the number after the letter. The D12-5 motor has an average thrust of 12 Newtons (4.45 Newtons equals 1 pound). The E9-6 rocket motor would have an average thrust of 9 Newtons. The E rocket engine is longer than the D motor, so even though it has a lower average thrust, it has twice the total power since it burns longer than the D. The number after the ""dash,"" for instance the 5 in D12-5, means that after the thrust burn of the rocket engine, there will be a 5 second delay before the parachute ejection charge activates. The info on those rocket engines led me to model rocket bodies, which use them, and I settled on using an Estes ""Eliminator"" which comes mostly pre-assembled."	218.0132546705336

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2132501745-2	This is roughly the same horsepower as the engines used to power a modern ultra-deepwater drillship or turn a ten mile drill stem buried in five miles of seafloor, but this was just to deliver fuel to one rocket engine.It's difficult to relate engine horsepower to rocket thrust. A piston engine doesn't move a craft by itself, so is usually rated by how much power it delivers to the drive shaft, a value directly related to throttle. Rockets provide thrust directly, so are rated by direct thrust, a value that changes with air pressure and craft speed. The piston engine will have constant 100% power, and the propeller's thrust will vary with speed. The rocket will have constant 100% thrust, and the power will vary with speed. This works out to have some odd results. Each F1 engine produced 1,522,000 lbf of trust on the pad--but the propulsive power of any rocket engine is zero until the craft starts moving. So, this static test is a lot of sound and fury for zero horsepower. The F1 produced 1,746,000 lbf of thrust at burnout, at which point the craft was moving at 6,000mph (1.67 miles per second).	150.86522071063882

KILT_15698501-0	RD-0120The Soviet RD-0120 (also designated 11D122) was the Energia core rocket engine, fueled by LH2/LOX, roughly equivalent to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). These were attached to the Energia core rather than the orbiter, so were not recoverable after a flight, but created a more modular design (the Energia core could be used for a variety of missions besides launching the shuttle). The RD-0120 and the SSME have both similarities and differences. The RD-0120 achieved a slightly higher specific impulse and combustion chamber pressure with reduced complexity and cost, as compared to the SSME. It uses fuel-rich staged combustion cycle and a single shaft to drive both the fuel and oxidizer turbopumps. Some of the Russian design features, such as the simpler and cheaper channel wall nozzles, were evaluated by Rocketdyne for possible upgrades to the SSME. It achieved combustion stability without the acoustic resonance chambers that the SSME required.	149.71540589048527

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2446045958-95	The compromises in the Space Shuttles design intended to keep down costs, and fulfil needs of the airforce, meant that this vehicle was proving much more costly and less reuseable than predicted originally.Cuts in NASA budget precluded it from developing a replacement heavy launcher for Saturn V, Ironicaly the USSR were able to improve aspects of the shuttles design with their Buran vehicle which was launched on the Energia booster. But the collapse of the USSR ended that programme. When the Venture Star programme was de-funded for lack of progress NASA had no choice but to extend the operational life of the Space Shuttle fleet which by now was the only way Americans could get to space. The ISS was a way to peacefully integrate Russian plans for Mir 2 and the American Spacestation Freedom. Building the ISS and operating the shuttle used up almost all of NASA budget so there was no money for anything else. After the loss of Columbia, it was crystal clear that the Shuttle programme should end and whilst it completed the tasks set out for it constructing the station, it was retIred afterwards. So for a long time the only way to get to the ISS was aboard Russian built rockets.	232.1540612131357

The old spacecraft basically plummeted through the atmosphere and splashed down in the ocean. It's tough to reuse equipment after a water landing. The new spacecraft would land more like a glider, on an actual landing strip. It took nine years from the start of the project to the first flight. In 1981, the Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off and its maiden mission was successful. NASA had succeeded in creating a reusable spacecraft. Columbia was followed by four other space shuttles: Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour. From 1981 through 2011, this quintet flew a combined 135 missions, with many involving stays at the International Space Station (ISS) [ source: NASA].

479	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	KILT_2230989-2	The shuttle TPS has three key characteristics that distinguish it from the TPS used on previous spacecraft:BULLET::::- Reusable: Previous spacecraft generally used ablative heat shields which burned off during reentry and so couldn't be reused. This insulation was robust and reliable, and the single-use nature was appropriate for a single-use vehicle. By contrast, the reusable shuttle required a reusable thermal protection system.BULLET::::- Lightweight: Previous ablative heat shields were very heavy. For example, the ablative heat shield on the Apollo Command Module comprised about 15% of the vehicle weight. The winged shuttle had much more surface area than previous spacecraft, so a lightweight TPS was crucial.BULLET::::- Fragile: The only known technology in the early 1970s with the required thermal and weight characteristics was also so fragile, due to the very low density, that one could easily crush a TPS tile by hand.	145.14585547003662

MARCO_msmarco_doc_45_1316021768-7	"The increasing acidification of the ocean — caused when oceans absorb immense amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels — inhibits coral's ability to produce the calcium carbonate exoskeletons they rely on for shelter.Water pollution, too, is wreaking havoc on coral reefs. Agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, oil and gasoline, sewage discharge and sediment from eroded landscapes make it difficult for coral to thrive, and therefore damage the complex relationships that exist among the plants, coral and other animals that are part of the reef ecosystem. As the temperatures of the world's oceans increase due to global warming, coral polyps expel the zooxanthellae they depend on for food. Once the zooxanthellae are gone, the coral loses its brilliant color, and all that can be seen is the white exoskeleton; this is referred to as coral bleaching. Coral colonies subject to bleaching usually die off, according to CORAL. Fishing practices such as cyanide fishing (spraying cyanide in the water stuns the fish to make them easier to catch), ""blast fishing"" with explosives and overfishing with trawlers can destroy a thousand-year-old coral reef in a matter of minutes."	136.3772217727892
481	145_1-1	What is happening to the corals?

Ten percent of coral reefs have already been damaged beyond repair, and if we continue with business as usual, WRI projects that 90% of coral reefs will be in danger by 2030, and all of them by 2050. Coral reefs are colonies of individual animals called polyps, which are related to sea anemones. The polyps, which have tentacles to feed on plankton at night, play host to zooxanthellae, symbiotic algae that live within their tissues and give the coral its color. The coral provides CO2 and waste products that the algae need for photosynthesis. In turn, the algae nourish the coral with oxygen and the organic products of photosynthesis. The coral uses these compounds to synthesize calcium carbonate (limestone) with which it constructs its skeleton—the coral reef.	123.86895712195836

Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by warmer-than-normal water, causing them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues, from which they get their energy. Coral turns completely white when it bleaches. If it remains bleached long enough, it dies. One scientist has already gone so far as to declare the Great Barrier Reef is now in a “ terminal stage .” Most of those studying the reef agree that what is happening is unprecedented. This is because, at a minimum, two-thirds of the 1,400-mile long reef bleached out last year, which led to 22 percent of it dying. Now another bleaching event has resulted in at least two-thirds of the reef bleached again.	117.96825362881646

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence. However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs. So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly? Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time. Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means. In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue. However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	198.9938482962898

Conservation By: Eva Gruber With the recent tragic news of the Great Barrier Reef experiencing the largest mass coral bleaching event ever, we can no longer ignore the fact that coral reefs the world over are in sheer danger. Coral reef ecosystems take centuries to grow and develop, and it is no small matter to be losing them due to anthropogenic activities in a matter of years. At least 19% of the world’s coral reefs – including 50% of those in the Caribbean – are already gone, and within 20 years, if current trends continue, we could lose another 15%, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_00_530877945-2	Once coral reefs die, they are gone for the foreseeable future, and due to their incredible importance as hotspots of marine biodiversity, the loss extends far beyond the reach of the ecosystem itself.Tropical fish populations decrease – nearly half the fish that the world depends on come from coral reefs. In Asia alone, 1 billion people need tropical fisheries for their food and livelihoods. The main cause of coral reef death is bleaching. Corals are colonial symbiotic organisms – the coral’s polyps provide a home for zooxanthellae (photosynthetic algae), which in turn provide the coral with oxygen, and the products of photosynthesis (glucose, glycerol, and amino acids) and help with waste removal. This symbiotic relationship is mutualistic, where both organisms benefit, and neither can survive on its own without the other. This relationship is the driving force behind the incredible productivity of coral reef ecosystems in otherwise nutrient-poor tropical seas.

486	145_1-5	What is the impact of dead corals on humans?	WAPO_ZFE3OMW5LRE3FECIUDCANAOSLI-1	The detection of a rise in heat waves over the ocean is unsurprising because they’ve already been documented over land thanks to global warming. Many studies have examined the potential consequences of increasing land heat waves including an uptick in heat-related illnesses and deaths, in the absence of adaptation. Extreme heat can also worsen air quality, stress infrastructure and decrease the productivity of outdoor workers, among other effects. But far less attention has been paid to heat waves over the ocean, which can have consequences of their own for both the marine environment and people. “This increase in marine heat waves is having devastating impacts on coral reefs around the world,” said Mark Eakin, a coral reefs specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Eakin said damage to reefs from these heat waves was first seen in 1983 in coral bleaching events, which have increased in frequency and intensity.	248.2457259088405

MARCO_msmarco_doc_16_3676861391-25	The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely.Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species. The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land. Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds. Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves. Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life. Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts. Climate change impacts on the environment Ecological collapse. Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide. Extreme weather.

489	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from.Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon. Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters. As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings. Grigg counted these rings to estimate age. In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals. 14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2. All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive. Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years. Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated. But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	283.26513328710234
490	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_1622110619-2	In addition to these opportunities, a range of ocean-based carbon removal approaches could help capture and store billion of tons of carbon.Importantly, these approaches would not increase ocean acidification. The ocean currently absorbs just under one-third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, which is contributing to a rise in ocean acidification and making it more difficult for organisms like oysters and corals to build shells. A few options for increasing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon may also provide co-benefits, such as increasing biodiversity and reducing acidification. However, many approaches remain contentious due to uncertainties around potential ecological impacts, governance and other risks. If research efforts increase to improve understanding in these areas, a combination of approaches could help address the global climate crisis. Ocean-based Ways to Remove CO 2 from the Atmosphere Proposed methods for increasing the ocean’s ability to remove and store carbon dioxide — including biological, chemical and electrochemical concepts — vary in technical maturity, permanence, public acceptance and risk. Note: This graphic represents the general types of proposed approaches, but may not reflect every proposal. 1.

Corals do not have internal organs and nor do they need them. Corals depend on algae, zooxanthellae, for their survival. The two are mutually dependent. The algae live inside the coral and use sunlight to produce energy which is used by the coral. The algae in return get a home to live in and carbon dioxide released by the coral. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read) Corals do not produce their own energy but get energy from the algae that live within them. Hence, they do not need a metabolism, blood, or heart.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_39_1141658031-5	This   substance   is   used   to   produce   shells   and   other   body   parts   by   organisms   such   as   coral,   clams,   oysters,   some   protozoa,   and   some   algae.  When   these   organisms   die,   their   shells   and   body   parts   sink   to   the   ocean   floor   where   they   accumulate   as   carbonate-rich   deposits.   After   long   periods   of   time,   these   deposits   are   physically   and   chemically   altered   into   sedimentary   rocks.   Ocean   deposits   are   by   far   the   biggest   sinks   of   carbon   on   the   planet.   Carbon   is   released   from   ecosystems   as   carbon   dioxide   gas   by   the   process   of   respiration.   Respiration   takes   place   in   both   plants   and   animals   and   involves   the   breakdown   of   carbon-based   organic   molecules   into   carbon   dioxide   gas   and   some   other   by-products.	228.0420170303987
493	145_2-1	What happens when corals die and the carbon falls into the ocean?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_20_666561210-3	As we’ve mentioned, calcium carbonate is one of the ways that CO2 is taken out of the ocean, and that is because it becomes apart of shells, corals and other marine life.When any of these die, they end up on the ocean floor. So over millions and millions of years, the dead marine life moves with the tectonic plates. Under heat and pressure, this calcium carbonate ends up becoming rocks (such as limestone), so we end up with a lot of CO2 eventually ending up in stone. So to sum: CO2 ends up in the oceans (which is already where most of it is contained), some gets formed into shells and corals which end up as stone or fuel (organic matter over millions of years), and by using this organic matter we’re pumping it back into the atmosphere. As such, it seems quite reasonable that we should just be able to pump it back into the oceans to help keep this cycle continuing for millions of years more. However, we’ve found that an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean increases the pH levels. For anyone that has ever had a tropical fish in a tank, they well understand how important it is to keep the correct pH levels.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_1480232399-5	The final stage of the pump is when these clusters of dead phytoplankton reach the ocean floor where they, and the CO2 they contain, remain for thousands of years.Role of Calcium Carbonate Calcium Carbonate is the primary ingredient that Clams, oysters, coral, and other hard-bodied aquatic creatures depend on to create their hard shells. This carbon compound is produced by carbon dioxide combining with calcium that has previously been dissolved in seawater. When these organisms die, their body parts and shells sink deep into the ocean to the seafloor, thus hiding, or burying, carbon. Over a long period of time, these dead organisms create carbonate-rich deposit layers on the floor of the ocean. After millions of years have passed, more and more carbonates form, which then creates heat and pressure that causes them to turn into sedimentary rocks. This includes chalk, marble, and limestone. Examples of Natural Carbon Sinks Now that you know the three basics, here a just a few of the many natural carbon sinks found throughout the globe.	145.31010885431897

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs. This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs. Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs. 2 . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers. Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral. 3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup. You don't live near a coral reef? Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef. Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations. 4. Learn more about coral reefs. How many different species live in reefs? What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms. Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs. 5. Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	242.08742846068344

Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white. But there’s a lot more to it than that. Coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, each helping the other survive. But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae. As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached. If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die. Protect Coral Reefs You can help protect coral reefs, too. Climate change poses a fundamental threat to coral reefs. Simple steps such as carpooling to work or using mass transit can help reduce your carbon footprint and protect these vibrant ecosystems.

498	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	WAPO_QVQ7DVUHHFCZLEONFBCD2PC2GA-0	Coral reefs are bleaching four to five times as frequently as they did around 1980, scientists said Thursday in a study that suggests climate change may be happening too rapidly for some reefs to withstand. “With a fourfold increase over the last 35 years, if you take that forward, it’s unfortunately in complete agreement with what the climate models have been saying,” said Mark Eakin, one of the study’s authors and head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch. “[We’re] looking at 90 percent of reefs seeing the heat stress that causes severe bleaching on an annual basis by mid-century.” Coral bleaching occurs when corals lose their color after the symbiotic algae that live in coral cells and provide them with nutrients are expelled due to heat stress. The longer this state of stress lasts, the longer the estranged algae stay away and the less likely that corals will recover.	122.23319408728275
499	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_48_1438883239-4	Globally, the ocean has warmed by about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, by a conservative calculation, and a bit more in the tropics, home to many reefs.An additional kick was supplied by an El Niño weather pattern that peaked in 2016 and temporarily warmed much of the surface of the planet, causing the hottest year in a historical record dating to 1880. It was obvious last year that the corals on many reefs were likely to die, but now formal scientific assessments are coming in. The paper in Nature documents vast coral bleaching in 2016 along a 500-mile section of the reef north of Cairns, a city on Australia’s eastern coast. Bleaching indicates that corals are under heat stress, but they do not always die and cooler water can help them recover. Subsequent surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, conducted late last year after the deadline for inclusion in the Nature paper, documented that extensive patches of reef had in fact died, and would not be likely to recover soon, if at all. Professor Hughes led those surveys. He said that he and his students cried when he showed them maps of the damage, which he had calculated in part by flying low in small planes and helicopters.	113.8581995430759
500	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_54_341156451-4	By 2016, bleaching occurred once every 5.9 years.That’s an almost five-fold increase in coral bleaching in the past 40 years. More than half of 100 reefs studied lost more than 30% of their corals in 2015 or 2016. 10 Ocean Acidification Shellfish and coral reefs suffer serious damage from ocean acidification also caused by global warming. Scientists estimate 25% of all carbon emitted goes into the oceans. 11 ﻿ The increase in carbon dioxide changes the chemical makeup of the water. This in turn causes the pH levels to fall, thus making the water more acidic. Since the 1800s, the pH level has fallen by 0.1 pH units. It doesn't sound like much, but the pH scale is logarithmic like the Richter scale that measures earthquakes. As a result, it represents a 30% increase in acidity. 12 ﻿ This is an alarming trend that creates a toxic environment for ocean wildlife.& nbsp; Effects on the Economy The most devastating economic fallout from water pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, occurs in four main areas: 13 ﻿ Cost of treating drinking water Losses to tourism (swimming, snorkeling, boating) Damage to commercial fishing and shellfish harvests Lower real estate values Let’s examine these in more detail.	111.24003008176624

MARCO_msmarco_doc_19_1932497705-2	If you’re just starting out, this can all be a bit confusing.My goal with this post is to help you understand how these two different systems – rack and panniers versus bikepacking bags – work, and how to approach choosing from amongst the wonderful array of options for your next pedal-powered adventure. Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms. What are racks and panniers? Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike. They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips. A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad. Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).	251.93450766676688

Generally speaking, bikepacking bags are made for off-road use while panniers and racks are made for road riding. Racks and panniers are generally preferred by bicycle tourists who need to carry all of the necessities for weeks, months, or even years on the road. Most bicycle tourists spend more time riding on the pavement and travel long distances. Often internationally. Bikepacking bags are often preferred by those who spend more time riding off-pavement, on long stretches of gravel roads, and single track through rural or wilderness regions. Most bikepackers take a minimalist approach to packing to keep the bike lightweight and agile. What are Bikepacking Bags? Bikepacking bags are soft bags that attach directly to the frame of the bike with straps and Velcro. No metal racks are needed. A wide range of bikepacking bags have hit the market to fit different sizes and styles of bikes. You can find bikepacking bags that will fit pretty much every frame. Many manufacturers are happy to build custom bags for you as well.	202.474948397954

MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_1306906707-6	Can you put panniers on a road bike?You can put panniers on a road bike but you will need a special type of pannier rack to do this. Since road bikes don’t have the mounting options on the frame (or ‘eyelets’) for adding a rack, you will need to buy a rear rack that attaches to your seat post to put panniers on your road bike. The only downside to this is that the seat post racks generally have a lighter weight limit given the alternative mounting position. That being said, on a bike commute you should still have no problems carrying all that you need on a road bike with panniers on a rack fitted in this way. The same road bike as above with a rear seat-post rack. This is an option if you want to commute on a road bike and carry panniers. Road bikes don’t have the pannier rack option because they are designed for speed and are therefore made to be as streamlined as possible. Adding panniers and a rack are therefore not what road bikes were originally intended for, but don’t let that stop you for your ride to work.

You can put a pannier rack on a road bike, or even a mountain bike for that matter, as long as the mounting holes are compatible. However, you may still have follow-up questions, which is why we’re going to take a closer look at this matter. A road bike does not have a fixed structure. Some have eyelets, while others do not. The length of the chainstay also differs. Lastly, different materials can be used on the bike, resulting in different weights. By considering these factors, you can find out how you can put a pannier rack on a road bike and which can be considered as one of the right pannier racks for road bike. With or without eyelets – To begin with, if your road bike has eyelets, attaching a pannier rack is quite simple. However, if there’s no eyelet, you should get racks that have clamps or brackets for the seat post. With this component, installation is much easier but less secure.	115.308234924074
509	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_1306897671-3	You would need to use bolts that come with your panniers to attach them here.Your rack can then be attached using a few simple tools like hexkey and a wrench, so there is no real need to pay someone to do it, although it would be cheap if you needed to visit your local bike store to ask for help with this. Do pannier racks fit all bikes? No, unfortunately not all bikes can have standard pannier racks on them, with most road bikes not being able to hold a standard pannier rack. That said, you can still buy a special seat-post-mounted rear rack that functions in a similar way to attach to your road bike. Although this will work for most bike commuters on road bikes, you should be careful not to overload a seat-post-mounted pannier rack since road bikes are designed for speed and are not meant to be weighted down. It is true that their frames can handle a fair amount of weight, but having this strain on your seat post, combined with it affecting the geometry of your road bike, could make it a little difficult to control your road bike if commuting with weighty pannier bags on the back.	108.16978874645427

Types of seats Rear facing only These are generally the bucket-style infant seats that most parents use for their newborns. These seats often come with a base that is installed in the car that couples with a removable seat portion. The seats can often be paired with strollers as part of a travel system. These seats are designed to be carried outside of the car so they typically feature lower weight and height limits. Once your baby has reached the limit for their rear-facing only seat, often that’s 35 pounds or 35 inches, they can move into a combination convertible or 3-in-1 seat with a higher weight and height limit. Convertible Most convertible car seats can be used in the rear-facing position until a child reaches the weight limit, typically 40 to 50 pounds. At that point, the seat can be converted into a forward-facing car seat. These seats are larger and designed to stay installed in the vehicle. They feature 5-point harnesses, which feature straps that have 5 contact points — both shoulders, both hips, and crotch.	220.0597709544818

Types of car seats Rear-facing-only car seats: These car seats, which face the back of the vehicle’s seat, typically come with a car seat base that remains in the vehicle. They’re designed specifically for infants and toddlers, who should ride rear-facing for as long as possible (i.e., until they reach the maximum highest weight or length for the car seat). Convertible car seats: Used as a rear-facing seat while your baby is small, these car seats can later be converted to a forward-facing seat after your child grows. Unlike rear-facing-only car seats, convertibles don’t usually come with a car seat base or feature a carrying handle. Booster seats: Designed to give kids a “boost,” booster seats help position your child so the seat belt falls across them properly. Some have high back seats, while others are backless.	154.7013828395866

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2255250854-13	Some of Marvel’s best which aren’t on this list: -Captain America: Winter Soldier/Nothing connected to Endgame, but it’s one of the best MCU movies -Black Panther/ Very different movie in terms of tone, excellent villain -Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2/I personally love this film, a lot of people seem to keep it lower on the list, but it’s definitely worth checking out -Ironman/ Amazing movie, introduces one of the best characters in the MCU perfectly. -Spider-Man: Homecoming/ A great solo film that has a fantastic villain and great performance from Tom Holland. So yeah, that’s pretty much it, the other movies (Thor, Ant-Man) are good, but Ironman 2 and 3 can be skipped as well as Incredible Hulk.

From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man By GamesRadar Staff 5 months ago Look back on a decade of the best Marvel movies – now with added Spider-Man: Far From Home! (Image credit: Disney/Marvel) With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect. There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable. But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible – we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time. The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other – so there's loads of choice. The good news is you can stream most of the MCU on Disney Plus now, and there's never been a better time to get caught up as new series launch on Disney Plus throughout the year, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.	129.89974664343936

I’ve seen “Avengers: Infinity War” twice now, and though much of the film’s cacophony has faded rather quickly, there’s one scene in particular that has stayed with me. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the adopted, brutalized daughter of the Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin), has agreed to reveal the location of one of the Infinity Stones that Thanos is searching for to stop him from torturing her sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan). When Gamora and Thanos arrive on the planet Vormir, they meet Red Skull (Ross Marquand, replacing Hugo Weaving), who informs Thanos that it takes more than merely tracking down its location to recover the Soul Stone. He’ll have to sacrifice something he loves. For a moment, it seems to Gamora and to us like this might be the fatal flaw in Thanos’s plan: It’s not a mighty hero that will stop him but his inability to truly feel love.	159.2043635561131

While Captain America (Chris Evans) remains on Earth and Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Titan, Thor goes on a side-trip to Nidavellir to get his hands on another powerful weapon that could kill the Mad Titan after Mjölnir's destruction in Thor: Ragnarok.

WAPO_KH5ECWN25FAZ7IUZ5EBGBCMDGY-1	Like every movie, each tells two stories — one that’s contained in the script, and one that’s unspoken but just as present. The MCU movies are, on the whole, super fun and entertaining. But underneath the stories of bravery and bad guys, they also have implications relating to, among other things, race and gender. Now come the cries of “Ugggggh, of COURSE Kristen has to mention race and gender the last time I have to read her stupid column.” And it’s true — those topics have been recurring here. That’s not only because they interest me, but because they’re topics present in nearly every film. We just don’t usually pay attention to them because films so often reflect society’s norms. All six of the original cinematic Avengers are white, and all but one are male. That’s a reflection of the comic book canon, yes, but the comic book canon reflects common biases: Superheroes who are white and male are the norm.	249.28104451613035

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future. This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task. While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward. Time travel is not the easiest thing to bring to the table, and there were plenty of people that poked some holes in the scenario that was brought up in Avengers: Endgame.

Captain America: Civil War - This one is my personal favorite and it’s a major event in the MCU. Sets up new characters and develops the relationships of our characters. Spider-Man: Homecoming - Same story with Ant-Man and the next two films, just a smaller scale solo movie to set up new characters. Black Panther Doctor Strange Thor: Ragnarock - Sets up new characters, develops old ones, and is a great segway to Infinity War.

WAPO_ZO3COGYHZVGOBAHV7PCWGZ22ME-7	This trend in the MCU takes on new urgency in the context of Feige’s new job as chief creative officer at Marvel Comics, a corporate shake-up ostensibly designed to replicate his silver-screen magic on the comic book page. And this means that those corporate politics may end up infecting the source material that remains the beating heart of the entire creative enterprise. Indeed, the look and feel of the titular team in “The Avengers,” down to Samuel L. Jackson’s role as Nick Fury, was directly inspired and shaped by 2002’s comic book miniseries “The Ultimates.” In virtually every other detail throughout the rest of the franchise, from the broad details of stories to the particulars of dialogue, the entire venture rests on those and other comics. He who controls the comics controls the fate of the entire Marvel enterprise.

Disney’s Marvel Studios, for a director, is so much more than a home and a soundstage and a distributor; it is a machine that you are plugged into — one that Feige has called a “very collaborative” process. A machine that arguably, so far, has an unmatched record of box-office success since the unlikely Iron Man and his electromagnet-guarded heart soared for the first time.

He said that Marvel’s “big new experiment” revolved around Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America. “You listen to the characters I named that we’re working on currently, and put them all together,” he said. “There’s no coincidence that they may someday equal the Avengers” — and before he could begin his next thought, he was interrupted by the volume of audience glee and hopeful extrapolation. Fan imaginations leaped ahead at the possibilities. Feige has cited that as a creative inflection point. It’s a moment that bears remembering when weighing just why “Avengers: Endgame” will mean so much to so many when it arrives in theaters April 26 — a three-hour culmination of more than a decade of superhero world-building.	213.6713302229764
543	147_2-1	What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?	WAPO_cf6c4460929817af773200b237d02872-0	Marvel rolled out its newest slate of movies today, and my Twitter feed has been exploding all afternoon with excitement over two of the titles in the mix: “Captain Marvel” and “Black Panther,” which will finally bring superpowered women and people of color to a big screen environment long dominated by white men in ridiculous uniforms. (Marvel’s television slate, which includes four series in development for Netflix, has been more representative.) As an advocate for diversity in media, it is nice to know that the people who found a way to make an animated dancing transplanted seedling look completely adorable have finally bestirred themselves to put a black man and a woman in costumes and endowed them with the power to punch things very, very hard. But as someone who loves action movies, I find myself reserving a considerable amount of enthusiasm until I have a chance to see the final results.	395.8134159293404
544	147_2-1	What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?	WAPO_NHSQOFLA7JB5LAS5LWDWOBWILU-0	This column discusses the plot of “Captain Marvel” in general terms.  “Captain Marvel” is the “Lean In” of superhero movies, an anodyne girl-power story that treats one woman’s journey of self-discovery as a proxy for galaxy-level change. Though the film is precisely engineered to appeal to critics like me — feminist women who came of age in the 1990s — it’s a disappointment, from the poorly shot action sequences to a shallowly written hero’s journey. More than anything else, “Captain Marvel” is the perfect caution that giving women and people of color top billing in major franchise movies is no guarantee that those films will say anything interesting, much less daring. In fact, the very scale at which these franchises need to appeal to audiences and the nature of their corporate entanglements suggests that these sorts of movies may be a trap for people who are eager to see not merely new faces, but new ideas of heroism, on-screen.	363.0383307886223
545	147_2-1	What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_46_269708404-2	Marvel and DC, for example, have come to their senses and started releasing female superhero-led films; women and people of color are finally being welcomed into the category as writers and directors; and even franchises defined by the most toxic masculinity of all have taken baby steps toward better, more equal representation in terms of race and gender (looking at you, 007).2020’s slate of action films encompasses some of the best of the best so far: There’s Harley Quinn leading her misfit girl gang in a series of undeniably epic fight scenes in the Cathy Yan-directed Birds of Prey; Wonder Woman and Black Widow taking it upon themselves to save the world yet again; and Ana de Armas changing up what it means to be a “Bond girl” in No Time to Die— a film which also counts Phoebe Waller-Bridge as the series’ second-ever female co-writer.

549	147_2-5	Is it really the case that diversity is to blame for Marvel’s dwindling sales?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_09_576853763-9	“Wonder Woman,” she writes, “isn’t only an Amazonian princess with badass boots.”This is a true statement. Unequivocally, resolutely. If you tossed a Lasso of Truth around that sentence, or strapped it to Marston’s lie detector, it’d read clean. She continues: Advertisement She’s the missing link in a chain of events that begins with the woman suffrage campaigns of the 1910s and ends with the troubled place of feminism fully a century later. Feminism made Wonder Woman. This argument represents the meat of the book, and the case Lepore lays out to support it is ironclad. A lot like Marston’s Wonder Woman, if you follow me. But she goes on: “And then Wonder Woman remade feminism, which hasn’t always been good for feminism.” This is just a fascinating statement, but the argument she makes for it gets largely shunted to the book’s epilogue, which covers the late ’60s onward.	211.8872721631633

WAPO_44725a7f377983eb07a8e93ce03e6d22-1	Warner Bros. has gotten pushback from some fans who claim the studio doesn’t seem to be giving “Wonder Woman” the same marketing juggernaut that it has given other DC superhero movies, particularly last year’s “Suicide Squad” and this November’s “Justice League.” Since “Wonder Woman” is the first DC movie with a sole female lead, it’s easy to assume this is another example of Hollywood’s sexist ways. Now, I call sexism out when I see it, and I don’t see it here. The truth is that, in the case of this movie, advertising can only do so much. “Wonder Woman” is the first movie in recent history that is both a superhero movie and a movie with a female lead. These are two divisive subsets: Many moviegoers either go to superhero movies or they don’t. Many others either go to “chick flicks” or they don’t.	202.52603194472613

MARCO_msmarco_doc_37_635771850-15	Rather, it’s been a decades-long process of bringing her characterization in line with overarching industry trends towards militant superheroes and violent altercations.Ultimately, Wonder Woman has never really been the hero she could be. Even in the Golden Age she was still objectified and her nonviolence used as a stand-in for female sexual submission. Ultimately, we’ve never actually seen a Wonder Woman who’s been empowered enough to radically commit to ideals of peace and love, without being sexualized, objectified, briefly (or totally) compromised, or undermined by her own narrative in the process. We don’t know what that hero would look like on screen, because we’ve never actually seen her off screen either. And if we get a different character altogether in Batman vs Superman, we’ll have 70 years of comics, not Zack Snyder, to blame.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_53_638341371-3	As we know, education is about knowledge.whether you are a student or businessman or employees or whatever,you need the knowledge to do those roles well.So education provides knowledge for that, and that is the main importance of education. Confidence Education can increase our confidence and the way we think. Whoever you are, if you are an educated person, you can face any issue with a positive mind. Without education, we fail in every place. We will lose when we don’t have knowledge. But a person with an excellent education can face anything with confidence. Also, he will have smartest ways to look at the problems. Becoming successful is not about minimizing your weaknesses and go on. It is also about thinking smart and has confidence in yourself. Enhancing the skills Education helps us to build skills like time management skills, interpersonal skills, organization skills etc. Those obviously help us when becoming successful. Schools create our knowledge skills, universities build our soft skills, and our experiences build our working skills. Whatever the source is, it helps to develop our skills. Whether you are an employee or a business owner, these skills we gained from education become an aid to your profession. That’s a main importance of education.	262.6430489020786
556	148_1-3	How would education have a positive impact on my tech career?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_03_34824319-3	Thus many view higher education as an opportunity to advance their vocational and professional skills.Colleges and universities are expected to measure and develop students’ hard and soft skills, preparing them to compete in a knowledge-based economy. Emphasis is placed on grades and on what will look good in a portfolio or a resume. Lord Robbins, a British economist, stated in 1963 that universities have four objectives: instruction in skills, promotion of the general powers of the mind, advancement of learning, and transmission of a common culture and common standards of citizenship. Clearly, learning for learnings’ sake is only part of the equation. Perhaps, as in all aspects of life, balance is key. Investing time in self-enlightenment is all well and good, but walking away with the skills required for an in-demand trade is not too shabby either.

This practice is becoming commonplace in society today, with a total of 45 percent of employed adults opting to invest in continued training to improve the skills most relevant to their duties at work. Americans are also starting to understand that, in order to stay on top of changing trends, they need to continue learning and developing new skills throughout their careers. In fact, 54 percent of adults acknowledge that they will need to pursue future training in their fields to “keep up with the changes in the workplace.” For adults without a bachelor’s degree, the correlation between career advancement and continued education is even more substantial.	222.1284458956361

The key to succeeding at interviews is proving that you have the transferable skills the company and job role requires; how will your experience benefit the business?

MARCO_msmarco_doc_55_985614412-4	While there is much value in connecting with people who work at other companies or in different fields, don't discount the importance of networking in the workplace.Whether you're new to the company and want to get the lay of the land or you're already established and have your sights set on a promotion, networking with your co-workers can be incredibly beneficial to your career progression. As you develop relationships with those in your department and in other divisions, be on the lookout for potential mentors, upcoming professional development opportunities, or new job opportunities that are not publicly advertised. Click on the following link for tips to help you effectively network in the workplace. The importance of networking in the job search It goes without saying that networking is incredibly important during a job search. Your chances of landing the job increase tenfold with the right employee referral. And, if you're looking to make a career change, your professional network can support you by helping you find connections in the industry you are trying to break into or helping you find leads for jobs at specific companies.	240.2430691174086

MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_863068249-5	Networking with industry professionals is one of the most important things you can do to expand your circle of contacts and gain “informational interview”-type advice that will help you in your cyber security job search.However, avoid exaggerating your connections to industry players. It will serve you far better to talk about who you read and how you stay current on the latest happenings in cyber security than to gratuitously name-drop (so avoid claiming that you’re poker buddies with Eugene Kaspersky). According to Forbes, the key to starting a lucrative career in cyber security is to “get involved in meetups, attend conferences, ask for tips over coffee with current security professionals of local tech companies. If these things aren’t possible, online networking is a good idea too.” There are dozens of cyber security groups on LinkedIn, with topics ranging from general to highly specific. 7. Don’t feel like you have to be an expert on everything The world of cyber security continues to evolve rapidly, meaning there will invariably be new technology, trends or threats with which you are not intimately familiar. Rather than present yourself as an expert generalist with across-the-board knowledge, highlight your own skills and experiences that best connect to what you see as the needs of the organization.	232.73725523541725

MARCO_msmarco_doc_54_1800957435-4	Stay Caught Up in Your Field of Interest As you start networking more, it’s important to do your homework by staying on top of what’s going on in your industry.Read the news, subscribe to relevant daily newsletters (for example, I like Mattermark for investing and EdSurge for education technology), and keep up with your industry’s movers and shakers. To figure out who to follow, I recommend searching relevant industry topics on Twitter and the Huffington Post, so you can get a sense of who is active in your specific professional community. You can even get involved in the conversation by interacting with those people on social media ( more on that here ). By staying up to date on what’s going on in your field, you’ll be able to break the ice when you meet new contacts and start meaningful conversations about professional topics. 5. Ask for Help You may be building a network from scratch, but that doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of the connections you already have. Ask your relatives, friends, neighbors, or even your mailman if they can introduce you to valuable professional connections.	212.3223144977528

573	148_2-5	What should I do next after getting an interview with a tech company?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_1503049432-11	So what you should be doing after you get home from an interview is: Deciding if you are interested in the position so can respond appropriately when they give feedback Tracking the dates of your past interviews so you know when to follow-up if you’ve heard no response Applying for more jobs!Never count on one single opportunity to work out, and keep applying for positions until you’ve accepted a job offer… You could do everything right in the interview and still not get the job. There’s a lot of luck involved in job searching. So counting on one single job offer is dangerous and could set you back weeks if it turns out you get rejected after the interview. So even though it’s tempting to wait and hope for good news, keep applying for positions and setting up interviews. What To Do Next: No matter how you think your interview went, the best thing you can do is keep job searching. Keep applying for jobs. Keep your momentum going. The biggest mistake I see job seekers make is they get 1 or 2 interviews and stop applying for jobs, and they just hope those first couple of interviews will turn into job offers. Don’t gamble. Keep applying.	186.4185264642001

Complete interview preparation checklist 9. Make sure to follow up after your interviews Think about how much time and energy it takes to get interviews… from writing your resume, talking to your network, applying for jobs online, sending endless scheduling emails, and finally taking time off from work to go to the interview. So after the interview, doesn’t it make sense to stay organized so that you can follow-up, check for feedback, and thank interviewers for their time to boost your chances of getting get hired? I recommend you track everything in a spreadsheet including: How many interviews you’ve had with them Date of last interview Next steps in process When they said they’d send feedback Whether you’ve followed up already or not, and on what date Then send thank you emails a day after the interview, and follow-up emails after 5-6 days if you heard no response. 10. Don’t tell coworkers If you have friends at work, it may be tempting to tell them you’re interviewing, but don’t do it!	154.3138468384277

MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_836362029-9	If you find yourself getting really nervous, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom to get some air.Don’t take too long but it is better to collect your thoughts than to plow ahead when you can’t focus. Fidget. This might be something you have to practice but it is worth it. Get defensive. The interviewer will be asking technical questions. Everyone has their weak spots and that is okay – work with it and practice for it. Bring coffee. What to do after an interview First of all, take a deep breath, you’ve gotten through the most stressful part. While waiting for a response from the hiring manager can definitely be frustrating, knowing what to do after an interview can actually help you influence the outcome. Once you’ve accomplished these steps, you can rest assured that you did everything in your power to get the job offer. 1. Drop off your thank you note. Always, always thank your interviewer after you’ve left. Email them after you drop off your note. The more contact you have, the more you remain in their minds over the other applicants. It shows you’re thoughtful, motivated, and that you care.	151.24247675575316

Author Gerald Murphy Date published February 17, 2016 Categories Analytics SEO In a recent article right here on SEW, Christopher investigated the manipulation of UK political party autosuggest queries, but what exactly is search engine bias? Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software. Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it. Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction. As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface. We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	156.96305199025664

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found. Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: "" [ T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others. Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries. Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries. ""While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.”"	154.40692199626938

This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.	256.32218868119526

In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be ""the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance"".

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant. But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble."" This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you. Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether. We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience. 1. Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode. In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account. This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results. To switch to private mode, click the menu button in the top-right corner of your browser and choose New incognito window (in Chrome), New Private Window (in Firefox), or New InPrivate window (in Edge)."	177.11680914997123

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines).There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative. Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer. A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself. (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.) Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms. I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all. The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	167.61161262166206

Also, it comes with parental control, which is very easy to configure to restrict minors’ access to inappropriate content. 2 .

However, it does not offer such attractive features as selecting images, news, and videos, which are present in the comprehensive search engines.

Ecosia’s Main Mission Is to Plant Trees Ecosia is a not-for-profit search engine that aims to help the environment by planting trees. The search engine’s mission is to absorb as much CO2 as possible by planting trees to try and reduce the impact of climate change. This is done for the planet, for people, and for animals. The service acknowledges that trees can help empower and lift vulnerable populations out of poverty through the regeneration of depleted soils and agroforestry food-growing programs. The search engine is also concerned with the plight of animals around the world that are losing their habitats to deforestation.	135.5222621266148

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_796224832-21	Use alternative search engines As Google and Bing have by far the biggest and most complete index of all search engines (at least for English content) there is no sensible alternative available.Especially specific long tail queries can not be answered if the index is too small or incomplete. Of course search engines like Duckduckgo that rely on the search results from Bing could be used as well, but would basically deliver the same results. Use specific queries and filter The more specific your queries are the less influence has the search engine to bias the search results. Be specific with your query Use the terminology of your preferred political side You can add or exclude author and publication names to the query. In advanced search you can limit your results to a domain or site. Joe and Mary Ann Lester Answered 1 year ago I don’t want a search engine that is conservative biased, but I do want one that is unbiased. I have simply lost trust in Google search. I don’t trust that their searches are not biased. There have been many credible reports of heavy liberal bias at the Google company and its subsidiaries. It is logical to worry that this same bias is built in to their algorithm that determines “what is most relevant”.	218.75030790881283

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant. But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble."" This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you. Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether. We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience. 1. Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode. In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account. This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results. To switch to private mode, click the menu button in the top-right corner of your browser and choose New incognito window (in Chrome), New Private Window (in Firefox), or New InPrivate window (in Edge)."	165.34743998651538

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found. Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: "" [ T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others. Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries. Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries. ""While some users may assume search engines are “neutral” or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.”"	163.52674455789384
598	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_19_633395304-17	"Biases can also be a result of social processes, as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non-normative viewpoints in favor of more ""popular"" results.Indexing algorithms of major search engines skew towards coverage of U.S.-based sites, rather than websites from non-U.S. countries. Google Bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political, social or commercial reasons. Several scholars have studied the cultural changes triggered by search engines, and the representation of certain controversial topics in their results, such as terrorism in Ireland, climate change denial, and conspiracy theories. Customized results and filter bubbles Many search engines such as Google and Bing provide customized results based on the user's activity history. This leads to an effect that has been called a filter bubble. The term describes a phenomenon in which websites use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see, based on information about the user (such as location, past click behaviour and search history). As a result, websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user's past viewpoint. This puts the user in a state of intellectual isolation without contrary information. Prime examples are Google's personalized search results and Facebook 's personalized news stream."	155.1367982531665

Ranking A good ranking ensures that from the billions of pages indexed you receive the most relevant results regarding to your query. A search engine could bias the search results either by completely filtering the search results from specific sites or by giving it a lower ranking, for all or for specific queries, and thus burying as rarely somebody looks beyond the first two or three results pages. Auto complete / suggestion / query rewriting Search engines assist the user in completing and refining their search queries, which ultimately influences the search results which are returned to the user.

When does Google decide not to interfere? Come along for some answers. Google & Search Suggestions Google was not the first search engine to offer search suggestions, nor it is the only one. But being the most popular search engine has caused many to look at Google’s suggestions more closely. Google has been offering “Google Suggest” or “ Autocomplete ” on the Google web site since 2008 (and as an experimental feature back since 2004 ).

MARCO_msmarco_doc_37_196841877-15	Google Suggest To be clear, Google Suggest isn’t a standalone keyword research tool.In fact, it’s one of the search engine’s basic functions. Whenever you enter a phrase into Google’s search bar, suggestions will appear as you type. For example, when I type, “sewing machine,” I see the following suggestions: Then, once I complete my search, I’ll see additional suggestions at the bottom of the results page. These suggestions are designed to help users find what they’re looking for more effectively. But because they’re created based on user search data, they’re also extremely valuable for keyword research. Each of these suggestions appears because they’re often searched by Google’s users. The list is algorithmically generated as a result of other popular and productive searches. This means that many of the suggestions you see in these spots deserve consideration in your keyword planning phase. Of course, since this feature isn’t designed with SEOs in mind, it doesn’t offer the easy export options that other keyword planning tools have. But you can still easily integrate it into your research process. Search for the main keywords you’re considering targeting. Then, scroll down to the bottom of the results page and copy and related searches that could be relevant.	200.51306850571564
606	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly.The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found. These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color. For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests. One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence. Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms. But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology. Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people. Take cannabis arrests, for just one example. Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	170.23941599973475

The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color. Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender. Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles. Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs. Many new technological systems promote themselves as progressive and unbiased, Noble is arguing against this point and saying that many technologies, including google's algorithm ""reflect and reproduce existing inequities.""

608	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	WAPO_DK4R6ILW2FHFXAZ2ZTBAQQWO6A-2	The algorithms — formulas for processing information or completing tasks — that make these judgments are programmed by people and thus often reproduce human biases, unintentionally or otherwise, resulting in less favorable outcomes for women and people of color. But the public, and even companies themselves, often have little visibility into how algorithms operate. “Women tend to be better credit risks. While it is illegal to discriminate the data indicates that controlling for income, and other things, women are better credit risks,” said Aaron Klein, a Brookings Institution fellow. “So giving men better terms of credit is both illegal and seems to be inconsistent with international experience.” Past iterations of Google Translate have struggled with gender bias in translations. Amazon was forced to jettison an experimental recruiting tool in 2017 that used artificial intelligence to score candidates because the prevalence of male candidates resulted in the algorithm penalizing résumés that included “women’s” and downgrading candidates who attended women’s colleges.	147.64917724952102
