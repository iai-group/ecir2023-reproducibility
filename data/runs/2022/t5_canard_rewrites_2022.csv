KILT_12150337-0	Criticism of the IPCC Fourth Assessment ReportThe IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is a report on climate change created with the help of a large number of contributors, both scientists and governmental representatives. There has been considerable political controversy over a small number of errors found in the report, and there have been calls for review of the process used to formulate the report. The overwhelming majority view of scientists with expertise in climate change is that errors, when found, are corrected, and the issues as identified do not undermine the conclusions of the report that the climate system is warming in response to increased levels of greenhouse gases, largely due to human activities.Section::::Content issues.Some observers have identified issues in which the peer-reviewed science suggests outcomes more severe than outlined by the report, while other observers have said that some conclusions in the report are not satisfactorily supported by the peer-reviewed science.	-0.0099046435207128

WAPO_8f59f92211e7f57ddd86df2ef0449d97-4	In 2007, the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report concluded that “most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations” — where “very likely” means a greater than 90 percent expert confidence in the conclusion. Then in 2013, the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report bumped the certainty level up yet again. This time, the report said, it is “extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” “Extremely likely” means a confidence level of 95 percent or greater. Not many scientific conclusions get this tag from the IPCC. Again, progress. So in sum, what can we say about the Scott administration climate scandal? At least two things. First, given the prevalence of climate change skepticism in the Republican Party over the past two decades, it’s safe to say that if a GOP politician ends up in an executive post (governor, president) overseeing a variety of science-focused agencies, then attempts to control climate science communications can clearly happen.	-0.0120597518980503
9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that.Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage. And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor. Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality. For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires. Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .” Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death. Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks. As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	-0.0030485368333756
10	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts.Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health. Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem. The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health. Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	-0.0042484034784138
11	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_11_94725514-2	Climate change can affect human health in two main ways: first, by changing the severity or frequency of health problems that are already affected by climate or weather factors; and second, by creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems or health threats in places or times of the year where they have not previously occurred.Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, but some populations will be especially affected. These groups include the poor, some communities of color, limited English-proficiency and immigrant groups, indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, people with disabilities, and people with medical conditions. Overview The impacts of climate change include warming temperatures, changes in precipitation, increases in the frequency or intensity of some extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These impacts threaten our health by affecting the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the weather we experience. The severity of these health risks will depend on the ability of public health and safety systems to address or prepare for these changing threats, as well as factors such as an individual's behavior, age, gender, and economic status.	-0.0069636269472539

To read more, visit Effects of climate change tallied up. Back to Top Factors Greenhouse Gases The increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity is often cited as one of the major causes of global warming. These greenhouse gases reabsorb heat reflected from the Earth's surface, thus trapping the heat in our atmosphere. This natural process is essential for life on Earth because it plays an important role in regulating the Earth's temperature. However, over the last several hundred years, humans have been artificially increasing the concentration of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases build up and prevent additional thermal radiation from leaving the Earth, thereby trapping excess heat.	-0.0166474729776382

The IPCC received 50% more nominations of experts to participate in AR5 than it did for AR4. A total of 559 authors and review editors had been selected for AR4 from 2,000 proposed nominees. On 23 June 2010 the IPCC announced the release of the final list of selected coordinating lead authors, comprising 831 experts who were drawn from fields including meteorology, physics, oceanography, statistics, engineering, ecology, social sciences and economics. In comparison to the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), participation from developing countries was increased, reflecting the ongoing efforts to improve regional coverage in the AR5. About 30% of authors came from developing countries or economies in transition. More than 60% of the experts chosen were new to the IPCC process, bringing fresh knowledge and perspectives.	-0.0291068349033594

In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020. The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow. For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead. These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	-0.0143590047955513

But while countries are still committed to meeting the carbon targets that were set at Copenhagen in 2009, the status of pledges on financial contributions from rich to poor countries is less clear. Rich nations promised at Copenhagen that, by 2020, investments of at least $100bn a year would be channelled to the developing world, to help cut emissions and adapt to climate change. So far only about half of that target has been met. The issue is muddied by a difference in interpretation among countries over what should be counted as “climate finance” under the Copenhagen agreement. Some developing countries want all of the $100bn a year to come from the public purse of developed nations. But rich governments are strongly resisting that, insisting instead that private sector finance should form the lion’s share of the total.

Delegates from almost 200 countries had hoped to put the finishing touches on the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord, ironing out a few wrinkles left over from last year’s conference in Katowice, Poland, and setting the scene for a major review of their efforts in 2020. But a year ago, Brazil pulled its offer to host the talks, and last month, stand-in Chile, rattled by anti-government protests, canceled five weeks before the meeting. Next, President Trump served formal notice that the United States was quitting the Paris accord, delivering a symbolic blow to one of his predecessor’s signature achievements. And scientists?

WAPO_LSKIXGFUK5DXDKYC7YMX62MX3Q-2	The promotion of fossil fuels comes as nearly 200 signatories to the Paris climate accord are gathering in Poland to discuss how they will carry out their commitments under the landmark agreement brokered by President Barack Obama in 2015.   Under that agreement, nations voluntarily set goals for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The idea is that although commitments are not legally binding, nations will feel enough pressure from their peers to take steps toward meeting the goals.  One of the purposes of the meeting, known as COP24, is to write a rule book for tracking emissions.   At recent international conferences, the United States has largely chosen to sideline itself from climate discussions. Just last week at a Group of 20 meeting in Brazil, every world leader present except Trump reaffirmed their support for the Paris accord. The planned event echoes one held last year at a U.N. climate conference in Germany at which representatives from the Trump administration and the U.S. coal-mining industry gave a pro-coal presentation.	-0.0457627326250076

He’s a meme sensation, one half of an unlikely bromance and a lover of ice cream cones. He’s viewed by many as a folksy, spontaneous and gaffe-prone elder statesman of the Democratic Party.

WAPO_da552161e78f2c80204622838bdaaed2-2	The United States sets its own targets, in pledges made to the United Nations, and like every other country, it is supposed to increase them over time. Thus, in the end, the United States does as much as it can or wants to under Paris. In fairness, the agreement certainly does assume that all countries are earnestly committed to cutting emissions. The current U.S. pledge, to reduce emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025, is fairly ambitious, and without such a pledge by the world’s second largest emitter, the Paris agreement would have been harder to reach. Equally surprising is Trump’s assertion that China “doesn’t adhere” to the Paris agreement. China’s commitments, too, are self-generated under the agreement, but no less significant for that reason.  Getting on the same page with the world’s top emitter, as President Obama did in late 2014, was key to setting the world on the road to achieving Paris.	-0.0035721559543162

On 28 May 2020, the COP Bureau decided that it would take place from 1-12 November 2021, in Glasgow, UK. The change in dates had been anticipated following a decision, on 1 April 2020, to postpone the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, the COP Bureau announced that: “In light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible. Rescheduling will ensure all parties can focus on the issues to be discussed at this vital conference and allow more time for the necessary preparations to take place. We will continue to work with all involved to increase climate ambition, build resilience and lower emissions.” The Italy-hosted Pre-COP and 'Youth for the Climate' event are also postponed.

Johnson is also expected to focus on climate change, a top priority for the United Kingdom ahead of the COP26 conference it is due to host in November 2021. UK Secretary for Business Kwasi Kwarteng has indicated that Johnson will be seeking coordinate action on carbon border taxes, green finance, the phase-out of coal and helping poorer countries to set up climate change. While the taxes have been backed by the EU and US, EU climate ambassador Mark Vanhuekelen indicated that Australia may oppose the measures.

"" The global pandemic and economic crisis eclipsed climate on his agenda. But he pivoted back to the topic Wednesday, announcing a ""green industrial revolution"" he said would address both climate and pandemic-related concerns — helping the country to become emissions-neutral while creating a quarter-million jobs and reviving the battered economy. Among the notable elements of his 10-point plan is a ban on new sales of gas and diesel cars to start in 2030. That's five years earlier than Johnson said in February and 10 years earlier than the plan before that. “The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand,” he said in a statement.

Back to Top Factors Greenhouse Gases The increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity is often cited as one of the major causes of global warming. These greenhouse gases reabsorb heat reflected from the Earth's surface, thus trapping the heat in our atmosphere. This natural process is essential for life on Earth because it plays an important role in regulating the Earth's temperature. However, over the last several hundred years, humans have been artificially increasing the concentration of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases build up and prevent additional thermal radiation from leaving the Earth, thereby trapping excess heat.	-0.0166474729776382

But while countries are still committed to meeting the carbon targets that were set at Copenhagen in 2009, the status of pledges on financial contributions from rich to poor countries is less clear. Rich nations promised at Copenhagen that, by 2020, investments of at least $100bn a year would be channelled to the developing world, to help cut emissions and adapt to climate change. So far only about half of that target has been met. The issue is muddied by a difference in interpretation among countries over what should be counted as “climate finance” under the Copenhagen agreement. Some developing countries want all of the $100bn a year to come from the public purse of developed nations.

The idea is that although commitments are not legally binding, nations will feel enough pressure from their peers to take steps toward meeting the goals.  One of the purposes of the meeting, known as COP24, is to write a rule book for tracking emissions.   At recent international conferences, the United States has largely chosen to sideline itself from climate discussions. Just last week at a Group of 20 meeting in Brazil, every world leader present except Trump reaffirmed their support for the Paris accord.

Another frequent plot device of this genre is placing one of the partners in an unfamiliar setting (like a different city or foreign country) or role (like requiring police field work of a non-cop, rookie, or office-bound ""desk jockey"")."	-0.0139590390026569

Photo by Sam Schipani Every so often, though, I like to clean up with a fresh face of makeup. There is one thing I cannot stand about makeup, though: waste, especially when it comes to removing my makeup at the end of the day. That’s why I decided to make my own reusable makeup remover wipes and DIY makeup remover. It not only helps me do my part to reduce waste in my beauty routine, but it also saves me money in the long run. Though the evidence supporting it is largely anecdotal, certain essential oils are considered effective for specific skin problems. I usually use lavender, because I like the smell and I hear it reduces blemishes. I also like peppermint because it allegedly helps with blackheads and dermatitis and it is just so darn refreshing. Frankincense essential oil is supposedly good for aging skin and rosemary is also recommended for oily skin, so maybe I will be trying that one soon.	-0.0148018011823296

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own. Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients. Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though! To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well. Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture. Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover. The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	-0.0192889422178268

81	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor.It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks. STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48. Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7. Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10. Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22. Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes. These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48. Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection. Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	-0.0659620389342308
82	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_278535003-10	This allows the product to properly soak in overnight.The antiperspirant benefits of these products don’t wash off as quickly as the deodorant components do when you’re showering. Longevity: The length of time that a deodorant provides effective odor and wetness control might be another important factor to consider. The longevity of each product will vary significantly based on the individual, activity level, timing of bathing, the weather and more. Residue: We all know how annoying it is to find white deodorant streaks on our dark clothing. Some deodorants also leave residue on lighter colored fabrics, and antiperspirants are often blamed for leaving yellowish marks on clothing over time. Certain common antiperspirants, such as aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, react with sweat and cause such yellowing. Cost: Deodorant prices range significantly, from under $5 to over $25. Because it is a product that you’ll purchase regularly, cost may be a factor when making your decision. Be sure to look at the net weight of product contained when price shopping; some of the containers are significantly larger than others. Also, consider product waste when using aerosol sprays. Although they contain more product than other deodorants by net weight, you lose some to the surrounding air when applying.	-0.0698599740862846

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_601334466-2	Obby The first on our list of Roblox games you can make at home is an “Obby.”An Obby or Obstacle Course is a great beginner game that will teach you the basics of Roblox Studio and the Lua scripting language. An Obby presents the player with a 3D Mario style game in which the player must proceed through a series of obstacles without perishing. Obstacle courses present a number of micro-challenges that get progressively more difficult as the player advances through the course. In an Obby you will learn how to use game elements such as Jumps, Kill blocks, Challenges, Checkpoints, and Level Advancement. In the Roblox Level editor you will need to learn about parts, scripts, materials, and transform tools in order to build a professional quality Obby. In order to make an Obby work properly, you will need to write some scripts using the Lua scripting language. While it may seem intimidating at first, Lua is an elegant, easy-to-learn programming language, and there many tools and resources that can help you master it. One concept that you will see in Lua while make your Obby is a conditional statement. In the example below, we tell the computer to set the player’s health to zero (thereby killing the player) if the player touches a block.	-0.0096404468640685

MARCO_msmarco_doc_54_1814425749-3	Another unique thing we love about this body scrub is that it is small-batch made and never mass-produced.Small match items ensure the quality of the final product is always as perfect and fresh as possible. The ingredients tend to be better, the process of making the scrub is more hands-on and wholesome, and you can feel good about knowing the scrub has not been sitting on a shelf somewhere for months. Along with the two different types of salt in the body scrub, they also include other organic and skin-loving ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and avocado oil that make your skin silky and soft to the touch. Grapefruit, blood orange, and lavender essential oils are also added to give the scrub a sweet, refreshing, and floral scent. However, the essential oils also have amazing benefits for the skin as well as reducing redness, calming the skin, and getting rid of dark marks. 3.

Photo by Sam Schipani Every so often, though, I like to clean up with a fresh face of makeup. There is one thing I cannot stand about makeup, though: waste, especially when it comes to removing my makeup at the end of the day. That’s why I decided to make my own reusable makeup remover wipes and DIY makeup remover. It not only helps me do my part to reduce waste in my beauty routine, but it also saves me money in the long run. Though the evidence supporting it is largely anecdotal, certain essential oils are considered effective for specific skin problems. I usually use lavender, because I like the smell and I hear it reduces blemishes. I also like peppermint because it allegedly helps with blackheads and dermatitis and it is just so darn refreshing. Frankincense essential oil is supposedly good for aging skin and rosemary is also recommended for oily skin, so maybe I will be trying that one soon.	-0.0148018011823296

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own. Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients. Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though! To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well. Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture. Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover. The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	-0.0192889422178268

110	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_msmarco_doc_08_33077731-2	You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries.Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance. Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion. Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean. If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required. You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts. Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly. Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl. Add fragrance or essential oil. Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz. of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz. of lotion. Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly. You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time. Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container. Enjoy your new scented body lotion. Warnings Choose a good quality lotion to avoid problems with separation and spoilage.	-0.0058327945880591

114	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_4513889243-4	Active ingredients are broken up in both cycles depending on the raw materials involved and the desired properties of the lotion or cream.A typical oil-in-water manufacturing process might go like this: Step 1: Add flake/powder ingredients to the oil being used to prepare the oil phase. Step 2: Disperse active ingredients. Step 3: Prepare the water phase containing emulsifiers and stabilizers. Step 4: Mix the oil and water to form an emulsion. (Note: This is aided by heating to between 110-185 F (45-85 C) depending on the formulation and viscosity desired.) Step 5: Continue mixing until the end product is 'completed' Careful note should be taken in choosing the right mixing equipment for lotion manufacturing to avoid agglomerates and long processing times. It can make all the difference in manufacturing time and costs. Conventional agitators can present a number of problems including agglomerates and longer processing times. On the other hand, high shear in-line mixers can produce quality lotions and creams without many of the complications encountered with conventional mixers. Sonolation is also a process that is growing in popularity. Potential health risks Acne Depending on their composition, lotions can be comedogenic, meaning that they can result in the increased formation of comedones (clogged hair follicles).	-0.0054246606305241
115	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_12_1463786556-21	Melt the mixture and stir in order to blend all the ingredients together.Remove the bowl from the heater water and allow the mixture to cool to body temperature. In order to keep the texture smooth, stir the mixture from time to time. When the concoction has cooled down, bring 8 ounces of distilled water to body temperature and place it inside a blender. Gently add a thin stream of oil into the water, with the blender turned on a low setting. A few minutes in, you should notice that the mixture gains a creamy texture, which will get smoother the more you mix it. Those of you that plan to add essential oils to the recipe, pour in just a few drops, so that you can gradually increase the fragrance up to a point where it feels enough for you. Good Night Lotion Want a relaxation lotion that’s easier to make compared to the previous one? The Good Night lotion isn’t just faster to make, but also requires fewer ingredients. The ingredients are 100% safe, which means that you can use the lotion on children if you want to. It’s based on the benefits that coconut oil and lavender have on the skin, soothing the senses and reducing anxiety up to a point where you are ready to fall asleep.	-0.0061192065477371
116	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_498928685-3	Add the other carrier oils to the beeswax and Cocoa butter and stir until everything is thoroughly incorporated.Stir in the Shea butter. It will melt as you mix it with the other oils. Once the oil mix and the 'water' mix have both reached a temperature of 110 degrees F, you are ready to start blending the two together to form your lotion. It's important that both the liquids and the oils be right at 110 degrees, otherwise they may not emulsify correctly. Using an immersion blender, start blending your carrier oils, which should have started to show a change in their texture by now (this is good). Very slowly, start adding little bits of the liquids into the oils, all the while keeping the immersion blender going. Slowly add more liquids into the oils in small increments until all of the liquids have been added. Continue to blend using the immersion blender for a couple of minutes, until your lotion reaches a consistency that you like. Pour the mixture into your jars, add labels, and enjoy! NOTES Lotions can be tricky and it may take some practice before you perfect your fluffy concoction.	-0.0077860439196228
117	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone.Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing? Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs? Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer. Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device? If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone. Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out. This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying. Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance. What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs? It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting. Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	-0.002251710742712
118	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_38_35848328-3	What features should you consider when buying a phone for your child?While there are many considerations and preferences you or your child may dictate on what features are most important — especially whether it will be an iOS, Android, or some third-party vendor-specific operating system, be sure to consider safety features, ease of use, and battery life. Ease of use: Some cell phones are made especially for children. They’re designed to be easy to use, and have features like limited internet access, phone number privacy, and emergency hot buttons. Screen size: While smaller phones are better suited for smaller hands, once you get to the preteen and teen years, screen size and camera features will come into play.

119	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_35_248298095-9	Amazon Prime Day is a good example of an instance in which it's probably a better deal to buy your phone through another retailer like Amazon rather than your carrier.Amazon mostly sells unlocked phones, which means the phone isn't tied to any specific carrier and will work with any phone service provider. That means you should be able to insert your SIM card into your new phone without much hassle. The most important factor to consider when purchasing a new phone is how much you want to spend. This will automatically limit your search, and you want to make sure you're not wasting time researching devices that are out of your price range. You also want to consider which features matter the most to you. Is having an excellent camera the most important thing, or do you want a phone with the longest battery life? What's your biggest complaint about your current phone that you're hoping to address by upgrading? Those are the types of questions you should be asking yourself. When is Amazon Prime Day? Amazon Prime Day is currently rumored to take sometime in June. In years past it's been held in July, except for 2020 when the annual shopping holiday was pushed to October.

My friend suggested I trade in my old phone towards another upgraded phone at Recell Cellular. I will also check these websites for the best buying. Deacon I think it’s great that you are buying used and also checking around to find the best deal and the right phone for you. Good luck.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_1007386097-5	If the phones on display don’t impress you, then you have the option of coming with your preferred phone.The only requirements are that the phone should be unlocked, not specific to a particular carrier, and it should be compatible with GSM Networks. Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular. Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone. Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones. If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display. Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers. Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them. Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan. After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward. Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose. The least you can pay for the plan is $15 plus an additional $5 for data and unlimited minutes.	-0.0084774158895015

Pacebutler The Pacebutler corporation will accept your old cell phones in order to recycle them properly. The mission of the business is stewardship of responsible environmental practices. Steve & Annette from MoneySmartFamily.com did Boy Scout fundraisers for several years. They collected hundreds of cell phones using free collection boxes provided by Pace Butler.

If you choose this route then make sure to include the cost of shipping and selling fees in your sale price calculation. Craigslist Craigslist is another option to sell your device directly to a buyer online without paying a fee. The one problem with the site is that you will have to meet the buyer in person. Be aware that there are scammers and frauds that will try to take advantage of you.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_33_97721069-6	Poor camera performance is to be expected with phones in this price range, but last year's Moto G7 phones could usually provide sharper photos in our testing.Should you buy it? Samsung Galaxy A10e 7.5 / 10 Maybe. I definitely enjoyed using the Galaxy A10e, thanks to its smaller physical size, great battery life, and lightweight design. The software experience is very close to what you'd get on Samsung's $1,000+ flagship smartphones, and performance was acceptable. It also works on all major US carriers, which is missing from Nokia's budget phones. However, the lack of NFC support and a fingerprint sensor might be deal-breakers for some people. As previously mentioned, Motorola is now selling phones for less money than the Galaxy A10e that have fingerprint sensors and full support for all US carriers — though you still won't get NFC for contactless payments. The Galaxy A10e also has an extremely poor camera, but you won't get anything significantly better from the competition at this price range. Buy it if: You want a Galaxy phone, but your budget is around $200. Your priorities are hardware/software performance and battery life. Don't buy it if: You take a lot of photos. You need NFC support or a fingerprint scanner.	-0.0199609566479921

You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10. Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app). And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers. We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_945711051-4	Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone.Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7. For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back. Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone. The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker. The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display. Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall. The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	-0.0011687598889693
136	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen.Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant. Blacks are much darker and inkier as well. When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too. That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles. One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent. You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes. Samsung did not add water protection to the A50. The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent. Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video? Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting. And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	-0.0016158869257196

The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7. I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone.Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing? Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs? Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer. Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device? If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone. Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out. This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying. Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance. What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs? It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting. Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	-0.002251710742712

Ease of use: Some cell phones are made especially for children. They’re designed to be easy to use, and have features like limited internet access, phone number privacy, and emergency hot buttons. Screen size: While smaller phones are better suited for smaller hands, once you get to the preteen and teen years, screen size and camera features will come into play. There’s no single best screen size, but pocketable is preferred so your kid can stroll around town without attracting attention from would-be thieves. Privacy settings: Your carrier and the phone itself should give you multiple choices for privacy settings and child safety controls.

Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone. I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being. ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void... ""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [ clouds]. What I should be looking at is inside me."	-0.0341647900640964

How long I run for all depends, but it's usually between five and seven miles.” Part of Mike’s daily routine at 4 am was going for a run when his enemies were sleeping. In fact in the book “Iron Ambition: My Life with Cus D'Amato” Mike talks about waking up at 4 to run 4 miles before he went to school that day! So why run? Mental toughness Running is great for a few reasons. The first surprisingly has nothing to do with the physical aspect of it. As most fighters will admit, fighting is as much mental as it is physical, if not more. Running helps build mental toughness. When you set a goal for the number of miles you want to run, you have to push yourself to get through it. Push yourself to do it daily whether it's rain, sleet, or snow, whether you feel good, bad, or just lazy.	-0.0393953472375869

It would be impractical to list every Android phone in existence, not only due to the huge array of varieties but also because virtually any phone can be an Android phone.

A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me. IPhone did that. People don’t grow fans out of thin air. There has to be stuff backing it. Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years. Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized. So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones. Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters. I am yet to test both phones but I am leaning towards IPhone.	-0.0063492720946669

168	134_3-5	That’s more about phones than mobile platforms.	MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_930919582-8	These platforms also eclipsed the popularity of smartphone platforms historically aimed towards enterprise markets, such as BlackBerry.There has been an industry shift from feature phones (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume sales, to high-end flagship smartphones, which also enjoy higher margins, thus manufacturers find high-end smartphones much more lucrative than feature phones. The shift away from feature phones has forced mobile network operators to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling-prices of flagship smartphones have had a negative effect on the mobile network operators, who have seen their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer feature phones. To help make up for this, carriers typically use high-end devices to upsell customers onto higher-priced service plans with increased data allotments. Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that include newer features and technology, and that smartphones were considered to be more relevant in present-day popular culture than feature phones.	-0.0052587753161787

Updated on January 19, 2021. Alright, alright, calm yourselves, keyboard warriors, we know this is something most of you would probably not agree with because let’s face it, with over 80 percent of smartphone market share in the world, the Android mobile operating system leads the rest of the competition by a mile. Perhaps because it is the OS adopted by many leading brands of smartphones, fragmentation becomes an issue that plagues Android-powered phone. Here is a post by Azzief Khaliq that argues for and against the effects of Android OS fragmentation you should check out. Here, the Windows Phone’s fast and user-friendly OS plus its integration with Microsoft-linked products has given many users, particularly who work a lot with Windows products, a reason to consider the integrated mobile platform. On the surface, it offers the same functionality (and perhaps a bit more) as do other platforms but these are 10 features that you may find better on a Windows Phone than on an Android. 1.

What makes a mobile platform successful? Nadella was probably right in his early assessment that there was no room for a third mobile platform in the traditional slate smartphone sense. Nadella made later statements about bringing an ""ultimate mobile device to market,"" that is ""beyond the curve."" This lends credence to the belief that his reservations about a third mobile platform were limited to refraining from competing in a market with entrenched rivals, invested users, an app store and developer economy that had passed slow-moving Microsoft by. The current 11-year-old mobile infrastructure revolves around app ecosystems, strong developer and carrier relationships, OEM partnerships in the case of Google and Android, and premium hardware and software synergy for Apple. From 2010 to 2015 Microsoft tried (perhaps half-heartedly) to adapt its mobile efforts to this infrastructure but failed miserably. Microsoft ultimately realized there was no room for another smartphone platform. And that's okay; smartphones are dead anyway.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_07_935369782-8	So it’s like running minus all the effort, which is what makes it a great cool down.Advertising If you’re wondering about the title of this one, it’s what I used to do when running in place back in PE class when I was a kid. 14. Tae Bo We’ve all seen the videos. At least those of us from the 1990’s have seen the videos of all the healthy people doing punches and kicks as part of their workout. While doing this for awhile can be a great workout, doing them for a few minutes make them great cool down exercises. This combines work outs with stretching in many cases, as you can’t really kick that high without stretching your muscles a little bit. So it’s worth learning a few Tae Bo exercises for a more fun cool down experience. 15. Yoga There’s a reason why yoga is considered exercise. That’s because it actually is. People can say what they want, but have you ever tried to hold dhanurasana for more than a few minutes? It’s not easy. Yoga poses can make great cool down exercises because they’re essentially complex stretches that wildly help your flexibility.	-0.0064762476831674

Running is an intense cardiovascular activity. So, a more intense warmup should be done before running to ensure a sufficient increase in blood flow, heart rate, and enough movement to loosen the tissue surrounding your muscles.

Jumping jacks Now we get back into lighter exercises that also work well for cool down exercises. A favourite is a jumping jack. 7. Swimming If you have access to a pool at your home or your gym, a quick dip in the pool can be great for cooldowns. 8. Get a Massage Okay, this one doesn't exercise on the face of it, but it can be effective as many cool down exercises. The point of cool down exercises is to transition your body from exerting to rest. Part of that is getting rid of pooled blood left over from when your veins and arteries pumping blood the body didn’t need anymore. 9. Exercise specific drills This one is a little complex but bear with me. If you’re a runner, you’ll obviously be working out your legs most of all. So doing some squats after a run keeps your legs pumping without the stress of actually running. These can be wonderful cooldown exercises. 10.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_34_1286244718-7	However, as you get more and more advanced, this type of scenario won't work nearly as well since you're sending multiple mixed messages to your body.Monday's workout would tell your body it's time to get big, but then Wednesday's workout will kick your body into a bit of strength mode. Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength. What is a confused body to do?! As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training). It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances. While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time. The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.

A jump-rope is a very inexpensive fitness tool. Top Choices for High Calorie Burning: Cross-Country Skiing: Average calories burned: 660/hour Cross-country skiing is an enjoyable winter activity that has the added advantage of providing a high-intensity full-body workout. The same workout you can get while on skis can also be achieved by using a ski machine, though many find this activity less appealing than the real thing. Swimming: Average calories burned: 800/hour doing the breast stroke at fast pace Swimming is probably the best cardiovascular activity you can try. It is extremely easy on your joints, and the water provides excellent resistance that allows you to tone your muscles.

You hold the weight up at your shoulders, squat down, and as you come back up you immediately press the weights overhead. You continue doing this at a fast pace, serving as a cardio exercise. 2 .

Breathing in, I follow my in-breath all the way through. Breathing out, I follow my out-breath all the way through. From the beginning of my out-breath to the end of my out-breath, my mind is always with it. Therefore, mindfulness becomes uninterrupted, and the quality of your concentration is improved. So the second exercise is to follow your in-breath and your out-breath all the way through. Whether they are short or long, it doesn’t matter. What is important is that you follow your in-breath from the beginning to the end. Your awareness is sustained. There is no interruption. Suppose you are breathing in, and then you think, “Oh, I forgot to turn off the light in my room.” There is an interruption. Just stick to your in-breath all the way through. Then you cultivate your mindfulness and your concentration. You become your in-breath. You become your out-breath.	-0.0094763226807117

Eat Healthy and Regularly Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight. Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses. Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals. Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat. If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.

In addition, fiber is ideal for individuals looking for what to eat to get ripped fast. Consume smaller portions of food A good trick to prevent you from consuming a lot of food and keep your weight in check is to use smaller plates and bowls when eating. This can help you a great deal as it simply allows you to take in lesser calories. Cook your own meals If you are going to lose weight, you have to cook more of your meals.

213	135_2-3	How often should I run to lose weight?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_831784062-2	In general you shouldn’t need to restart your smartphone very often at all.Certainly not more than once or twice a week, even when it is older. Of course, how your device runs is only one part of the equation. Power draw is the other. Generally speaking restarting a smartphone will drain battery life, and switching off your phone overnight (and then restarting it) will use as much power as it takes to leave it on all the time. Smartphones and tablets are designed to go to sleep and draw very little power. So restart only when you need to. How often should you restart your tablet? In essence, for ARM-based tablets such as iPads and Androids this is the same as with smartphones. Your tablet should be able to remain on pretty much all the time. Restart it if things are getting slow or buggy, or if you need to complete a software install. Other than that, let your tablet work and sleep as intended. Things are different, although only slightly different, for x86 Windows tablets such as the Surface Pro range. These you should treat like Windows 8 laptops (advice on which can be found in the section below).	-0.0097042005509138

By Andrew Tufts, on Saturday, January 18, 2014 Most people don’t reboot their phone very often. Personally, the only time my phone restarts is when it runs out of battery life away from the charger or when something catastrophic happens. Neither of those things happens very often. But should people like me and you reboot their Android devices more frequently? Or is it an absolutely pointless function that does nothing to help Android? Let’s find out! Reasons to restart: -Installing important Android updates (not just app updates) -You’ve encountered a serious error, slowdown problem, or other issue -Your phone feels laggy and slow and you think restarting will help -You’re rooting your phone and booting into development mode Reasons not to restart: -It takes a while -It drains battery life -You can’t use your phone for about 2 minutes Conclusion You really don’t need to reboot your Android often or at all. The only time Android really needs to reboot itself is when it encounters a major kernel/OS problem. And in 90% of these cases, Android will detect an error and shut itself down anyway.	-0.0117203695699572

You could manually shut down processes and apps, and that may solve your problem, but restarting does this job and also frees up RAM. Usually that double whammy will solve any problems you are having with your phone. As with any computational hardware, if your phone is suddenly running much hotter than usual it is worth trying a restart. But if you are experiencing any of these regularly, there may be something wrong with your smartphone. In general you shouldn't need to restart your smartphone very often at all. Certainly not more than once or twice a week, even when it is older. Of course, how your device runs is only one part of the equation. Power draw is the other. Generally speaking restarting a smartphone will drain battery life, and switching off your phone overnight (and then restarting it) will use as much power as it takes to leave it on all the time. Smartphones and tablets are designed to go to sleep and draw very little power. So restart only when you need to.

The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity. In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower. However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher. At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.

220	135_2-7	So what's a better alternative to running on an empty stomach?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_09_17958275-2	Is it better to run on an empty stomach?First, consider the time and effort. If you’re running less than 60 minutes at an easy pace, you may not need to eat anything—your body has enough glycogen (its preferred fuel source) stored to power you through, but you should focus on refueling properly afterward. Any run lasting longer than 60 minutes or performed at a vigorous to intense effort may require some extra fuel to keep you going. That said, everyone is different and multiple factors influence this so if you find you’re hitting the wall on most runs around mile four or 45 minutes in, then you’ll adjust your fuel plan accordingly. If you choose to eat before the run, in order to get that food in and digested, one option is to see if you can go to bed a half-hour earlier and then drag yourself out of bed thirty minutes earlier, which would give you time to digest a more substantial meal. But, I realize how precious every minute of sleep can be, and also how difficult it can be to get in bed earlier, so here are some other ideas.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_09_18864409-2	When we exercise, the opposite occurs; blood flow is redirected from internal organs to the large working muscles to provide the necessary energy for muscle contraction.When we have a large amount of food in our stomach, running is difficult or uncomfortable because our body is simply not designed to do both digestion and exercise at the same time. Stomach cramps, stomach aches, or gastro-intestinal distress are the most common complaints when trying to run on a full stomach. The mechanical mixing and jostling that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract too. Now that said, some athletes are able to eat and run. Endurance athletes train their bodies to eat on the run. Even at the marathon distance, runners must ingest some nutrition during the race, although hardly a large meal. Experimenting in your training with eating and running will let you know just how much you are able to eat before a run. For the best training results though, allow three to four hours after eating before running, especially if the workout calls for some intensity. All the best, Susan Paul, MS	-0.0102087715640664

MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_959902068-3	Eating Too Much Jonathan KnowlesGetty Images This should seem obvious, but it needs repeating: Avoid eating a big meal too close to the start of your run.We have all heard about the importance of carb loading for runners, but a big plate of eggs benedict—even though it’s loaded with many necessary nutrients—is not going to feel so good sitting in your stomach. It’s important to time your nutrition for best results. The digestive process slows down while we run and is unable to operate as usual because the normal blood flow to our gastro-intestinal (GI) system is diverted during exercise. (The diverted blood flow is redirected toward working muscles.) Therefore, if we eat a meal, especially a large one, food is not able to be digested normally, likely causing some sort of GI distress like cramping, side stitches, or worse. If you are running first thing in the morning—for shorter runs—you may not even need to eat at all. Running on an empty stomach for runs less than an hour is pretty simple for most. However, if you are running later in the day, then it becomes increasingly important to watch your food intake.	-0.0099033443257212

MARCO_msmarco_doc_22_1470097179-2	How to Avoid Stomach Pain When Running 1) Do not Run on a Full Stomach You should not consume large amounts of water or consume 2-4 hours prior to workout.Sip small amounts (1-2 swallows) prior to and during exercise and wait to fully re-hydrate up until after the workout. Dehydration can trigger cramping too, so do not overlook water/Gatorade during running. Always sip a couple of swallows at regular intervals if running for more than 30 minutes and in hot temperature levels. 2) Decrease Pace and Breath Deeply Decline fast lane for a few minutes and continue deep breathing techniques throughout running. A typical running series is a 3 action inhale and 2 step breathe out pattern. Decreasing your pace will allow for you to keep up with that pattern. As you increase to near maximum speed, your breathing will become more labored. However, you can press through the pain and keep your speed if you concentrate on breathing deep by pressing your stomach out when you inhale and relaxing it as you breathe out. 3) Pre-Stretch With Side Torso Twists Pre-stretch before running by doing side torso twists. Among the best methods to pre-stretch the location is to lift your arms over your head and lean to the left and right at the waist.	-0.012784662656486

Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure.On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate. The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon. In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal. It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	-0.0264336224645376

MARCO_msmarco_doc_07_972639324-9	The break-in was a war game, an exercise.What's the lesson we can all learn from the bizarre mistakes that led to the Watergate scandal? Mainly, that a military mindset can act as psychological poison. A government that finds itself in a troubled position in time of war may also find itself in a manic state of unreality in which things that don't make sense begin to make sense. This is a pretty scary truth, and it probably explains many moments in history, far beyond the relatively modest historical scope of the Watergate affair. This psychological explanation for the Nixon downfall is markedly a systematic rather than an individual one. It's common to paint the Watergate scandal as a manifestation of Richard Nixon's personal character flaws. Like the explanations for the break-in above, this wider explanation is not very insightful, and misses a bigger point. If we blame the mistakes of Watergate on the character flaws of Richard Nixon, we fail to see that it's our own entire society that is more deeply at fault. The Watergate scandal was caused by the mania that surrounded the Vietnam War. It was the Vietnam War coming home to roost. Perhaps Mitchell and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and Colson and Nixon might have actually meant well, or might have at least meant to meant well.	-0.0083362711593508

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell. At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty. G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison. Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC). Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.

Subsequently, McCord suggested that Magruder, Mitchell, and Dean all were involved in the planning of the burglary and cover-up. While McCord's assertion turned out to be only hearsay evidence, obtained from Liddy, the grand jury was reconvened, the prosecutors subpoenaed Dean, and the Ervin committee began focusing on the roles of Dean and Magruder. To intensify the pressure on Dean, the prosecutors held long secret sessions with Liddy, and though Liddy steadfastly refused to discuss the case in these well- publicized sessions, the prosecutors intentionally promoted the story that Liddy was talking and implicating Dean and Magruder. As President Nixon's transcripts confirm, the ruse succeeded: Dean believed that Liddy, who had attended meetings with him and Mitchell which eventually led to Watergate, was plea bargaining with the prosecutors."	-0.0093215014785528

Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and John Dean, Attorney General John Mitchell and Nixon assistant Alexander Butterfield.Perhaps the most surprising revelation that emerged from the hearings was the acknowledgement of listening devices and a taping system in the Oval Office, which were confirmed by Butterfield in his appearance before the committee. The existence of such a taping system set off a protracted legal battle between federal courts and the president. After losing his fight to keep the tapes private, Nixon eventually handed them over to special investigators who discovered an 18 and-a-half minute gap on one of the tapes, which audio experts later said had been deliberately erased. To this day, no one knows what was erased, but most believe it was some type of incriminating evidence spoken by someone in the Oval Office -- mainly because it occurred at a portion of the tape where the Watergate investigation was being discussed. Advertisement Ultimately, the tapes provided incontrovertible evidence that Nixon at one point attempted to obstruct justice by asking to use the CIA to shut down the FBI's Watergate investigation. Months later, Nixon brought even more trouble upon himself when he ordered the firing of special Watergate investigator Archibald Cox -- presumably to get the heat off him.	-0.0059358980506658

Cox issued a subpoena, or court order, directing Nixon to give Cox some of the tapes. Nixon responded by firing Cox. Public outrage forced Nixon to appoint another prosecutor, Leon Jaworski (1905–1982), to continue the investigation. On March 1, 1974, a grand jury charged U.S. attorney general John N. Mitchell (1913–1988) and six other officials from the Nixon administration with conspiracy to obstruct investigation of the Watergate burglary. Nixon was named as one of the conspirators, but he was not charged as an accused criminal. In April 1974, Jaworski issued a subpoena, again asking Nixon to produce tape recordings of Oval Office conversations. Jaworski said he needed the tapes for the criminal trial of Mitchell and Nixon's other officials. This time, Nixon asked the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia to quash, or strike down, the subpoena.	-0.0065499143674969

Haldeman, in the Oval Office on June 23, 1972. The conversation took place from 10.04am to 11.39am. The recording subsequently became known as the Smoking Gun and led directly to Nixon’s resignation. The release of the tape was ordered by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974, in a case known as United States v. Nixon. The court’s decision was unanimous. President Nixon released the tape on August 5. It was one of three conversations he had with Haldeman six days after the Watergate break-in. The tapes prove that he ordered a cover-up of the Watergate burglary. The Smoking Gun tape reveals that Nixon ordered the FBI to abandon its investigation of the break-in. After the release of the tape, the eleven Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who voted against impeachment charges said they would change their votes. It was clear that Nixon would be impeached and convicted in the Senate. Nixon announced his resignation on August 8.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power. Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever. The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat. The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	-0.0032745571807026

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal. The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded. Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president. Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms. But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation. 1. The Supreme Court remained supreme. It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.	-0.00336723215878

Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate. In surveys of historians and political scientists, Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks restored the president's power.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure.On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate. The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon. In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal. It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	-0.0264336224645376

It suggests the legendary editor privately doubted aspects of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's reporting that helped bring about the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974. The story prompted a strong denial from Woodward, a demurral from Bradlee, an online chat at Poynter and a Daily Beast story by independent scholar Max Holland, who argues Woodward and Bernstein's book about the scandal, ""All the President's Men,"" is ""a fairly tale, albeit a compelling one.""

When five men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate hotel in 1972, Felt was the man chosen to head up the investigation. His mission was to determine the involvement, if any, of the White House. After being pressured from upstairs to stay clear, Felt decided the press was the only way to expose the corruption and the White House’s complicity.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_719719292-1	Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation. He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation. This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence. Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	-0.0053008715622127

MARCO_msmarco_doc_30_1549247804-2	Bostrom’s biggest argument for this belief is called the simulation argument, which he states that, if ancestor simulations are something an advanced civilization would end up creating, then most of the self aware minds that ever come into existence, are simulated ones.Another argument for this belief is the idea of the Boltzmann brain, which argues that in an infinite multiverse, it should be tremendously more common for particles to randomly assemble into a brain that is having the exact same experience as you are having right now, than for particles to create big bangs.Ancestor simulations is a belief proposed by Nick Bostrom, a professor at Oxford University, he believes that, in the future, it will be possible to simulate the actions of all the neurons in the brain and simulate the sensory input to that brain with enough accuracy to convince the simulation that it is a real person. For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_719719292-1	Review of Bostrom's Simulation Argument Brian Eggleston In “Are you living in a computer simulation?”, Nick Bostrom presents a probabilistic analysis of the possibility that we might all be living in a computer simulation. He concludes that it is not only possible, but rather probable that we are living in a computer simulation. This argument, originally published in 2001, shook up the field of philosophical ontology, and forced the philosophical community to rethink the way it conceptualizes “natural” laws and our own intuitions regarding our existence. Is it possible that all of our ideas about the world in which we live are false, and are simply the result of our own desire to believe that we are “real”? Even more troubling, if we are living in a computer simulation, is it possible that the simulation might be shut off at any moment? In this paper, I plan to do two things. First, I hope to consider what conclusions we might draw from Bostrom’s argument, and what implications this might have for how we affect our lives. Second, I plan to discuss a possible objection to Bostrom’s argument, and how this might affect our personal probability for the possibility that we are living in a computer simulation.	-0.0015663747908547

MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_365440623-2	He pointed to the large intelligence gap between chimpanzees and humans despite our 98 percent DNA overlap, arguing that a creature many times our intelligence could both exist and potentially run simulations.Other arguments for simulation theory come from philosopher Nick Bostrum and theoretical physicist James Gates. In 2003, Bostrum suggested that advanced civilizations with massive computing power might decide to run simulations of their ancestors — us — and, given the sophistication of the technology, we wouldn’t know that we’re nothing more than computer programs. Gates, meanwhile, found “error-correcting codes” — similar in principle to those used in Web browsers — while studying equations about electrons and quarks, said Scientific American. Even more concerning if you’re worried about a universe simulation? It’s almost impossible to prove we’re in a real universe because any “evidence” could be part of the program. Evidence of a “Real” Existence? Despite solid philosophical and theoretical arguments, a team from Oxford University has found reasonably solid evidence that our universe is more than a mobile application. The proof? Attempting to model specific quantum phenomena such as the Hall effect quickly gets out of hand — according to Cosmos, modeling just a few hundred electrons using the quantum Monte Carlo technique requires more atoms than exist in the universe.	-0.0028663286939263

MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_467976492-2	Well, currently multiverse theory is… just that, a theory.As it stands, the multiverse exists outside our current scientific understanding of reality. Theoretical physics suggests a multiverse is a hypothetical grouping of multiple universes. This means that our Universe could be just one tiny universe in a much larger multiverse where many, possibly even infinite universes, are contained. Interestingly enough, even though much of multiverse theory is hypothetical or imagined, there is some scientific grounding to parts of it. But where to begin? First, not all scientists agree that the multiverse could exist—or that it’s worth exploring. Second, there are actually a few different theories, each which can help to explain certain anomalies in our Universe. (But could also break some currently known things.) Let’s focus on the eternal cosmic inflation theory. This theory starts with the Big Bang. It is suggested that as our Universe expanded into existence, it started off rapidly, then slowed—like when you inflate a balloon. This rapid expansion created our Universe, but also other universes in a vast bubble-like multiverse. While parts of the universe stopped the extremely rapid “inflationary” expansion and “budded off” to become normal space, large parts of the Universe have continued to inflate even now.	-0.0087527902796864

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in. Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory. For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering. What Is It? The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience. These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously. These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.” What are These Parallel Universes?

If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes. The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically. Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy. In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James. However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	-0.0117261428385972

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_729492685-3	Image via Disney/Marvel That’s where the driving plot of Infinity War comes in, which co-director Joe Russo describes as a heist movie of sorts: “He’s on a hunt.We’re using a bit of a ’90s heist genre component. Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.” So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him. Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power. We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great. This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies. Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	-0.0268463864922523

Since we're talking about the Fantastic Four, the theory also offers up a potential villain for the third film in the form of Kang the Conqueror. The time-traveling baddie is intimately connected to the FF, and his introduction could supply the MCU with another potential Thanos -level threat to come into play in future movies. But really, when have we ever known the plot of a Marvel movie prior to its release?

Be sure to talk to people you meet online through video chat before you meet up. Meet in a public place and bring someone with you. Online friendships aren't just made by adults, so it is important to be aware of the potential that your teenager might make friends online whether you know about it or not. Many teensreport having one or more online friendships or friends that they initially met online. If you are the parent of a teen that makes friends online, it is understandable and unavoidable that you will be concerned. Your concern is valid. When a teenager wants to find a way to meet an online friend in person, it's hard to stop them. One of the things you can do is support them and accompany them when they meet an online friend for the first time. That way, you can avoid the possibility that they might sneak out or do something equally as unsafe so that they can meet a person from the internet.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_47_578522580-4	Teenagers often take criticism as ridicule or shame.At times, when criticism is unavoidable, watch your tone. 4. Encourage Extra Curricular Activities: Let your teenager follow his hobbies. Encourage him to participate in more and more activities. It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys. Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence. These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal. [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5. Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make. Teach him about respect and acceptance. Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important. Teach him that value is what matters between friends. The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence. Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends. 6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure. To them looks matter a lot. They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely. It is important to sit and explain to your teenager that looks do not matter.	-0.0041878623887896
289	138_1-7	Awesome. He cares a lot about looks also. What can I do about that?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_39_1330701444-6	At the very least, this will let her know that she is not alone and that everything ultimately worked out fine for you.If the bullying is extremely severe, you can even discuss the option of changing schools. 6. Appearance Problem: Girls want to look pretty, and the media has made an almost unattainable idea of beauty. Her body is constantly changing as well, so adjusting to this can make it even more difficult. Solution: Watch your teenager and make sure that she does not suddenly start eating too little or adopting strange diets. Make sure she knows that these looks are just fads, and unhealthy eating habits can affect her for the rest of her life. You should also make sure that she does not hang out with friends who have negative habits involving their appearance. 7. Friendship Problem: While friends can make life worthwhile, they can also cause a lot of stress. An ugly fight with a best friend can leave your daughter in tears. Teenagers are still working to develop their social skills, so many teenage friendships are prone to mood swings and instability. Solution: Let your daughter know that fights are normal. While they shouldn’t be violent, even the best of friends have differences of opinions at times. Encourage to discuss these problems, forgive and forget.	-0.0080471821129322

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_1773158489-24	It has been really hard now in High School, she has no friends, she mostly spend lunch periods alone : ( and we are just praying and waiting for the medication to help her.A good friend this moment will be very helpful for her, but it’s hard to find teenagers that care about other teenager that look depressed, they actually pull away from depressed kids and call them “weird”. I don’t know what else to do. She is a sporty girl, she used to play rep soccer, nothing is the same anymore, her self stem went really low. I hope everyday will be better but no yet, it looks like sometimes she gets worse. Reply La Cat November 15th, 2017 at 11:57 AM Dear Yorlene I am so sorry to hear about your daughter’s situation and can fully understand as the same thing happened to my daughter when she was 12. After being picked on for a couple of years by some mean girls she became sad and depressed (which was so unlike her) and ended up being off school for a month while I hoped the school would acknowledge the problem and try to remedy it.	-0.0104601951315999
291	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	KILT_52411400-2	Using 7 or more social media platforms has been correlated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents. While making friends is possible on social media, adolescents using social media may experience loneliness and question others' genuineness. The parents of adolescents may not understand social media fully and are concerned about safety and the effect of social media on social development. The increased role of social media and technology in adolescents' daily communications may affect their development of in-person relationships. Increased social media usage may impact how adolescents socialize face-to-face, leading to social isolation when faced with self-doubt or a lack of confidence. Social media can significantly influence body image concerns in female adolescents. Young women who are easily influenced by the images of others on social media may hold themselves to an unrealistic standard for their bodies because of the prevalence of digital image alteration. Engaging with social media platforms two hours before falling asleep can seriously effect sleep quality, and a longer duration of digital media use is associated with reduced total sleep time.	-0.0017363247461616
292	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life.This might also result in inability to empathize. These sites make kids prone to sensationalism. A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall. Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media. A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison. This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence. However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships. Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”. After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody. Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	-0.0032923799008131

WAPO_0af01e9053c7d7eb8df7ea4ebe5c8cb0-5	It is true that the anonymity of the Internet allows easily for cyberbullying, but it also makes it easier to stand up to bullies. Your tween/teen can stand up to the mass mentality of group chats or the mean girl tagging and excluding on Instagram. Social media offers tween and teens a place to make good choices and skin their knees safely as they develop the resilience and confidence needed to navigate their world online and offline. They might not be able to do it alone. Tweens and teens can use their parents to find positive role models and navigate sticky situations. If you are involved in your child’s digital life, you can offer suggestions and advice on how to be kind online. Social media offers kids a place for social change and parents an effective forum to encourage kindness and citizenship. 5. Use social media to present your best self: We all know that your digital footprint starts at birth and that children’s lives are chronicled online.	-0.0035246410407125
294	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_1743844487-4	Don’t let, “Take the trash out” turn into, “You always forget to do your chores because you’re lazy.”Critical self-talk mirrors messages that we absorb about ourselves in early childhood. So, change the conversation to overcome issues with self-esteem for teens. Esteem-Building Tips Besides rewriting the inner dialogue, help your teen take these steps to improve self-worth: Celebrate what they do well. Focus on effort instead of perfection. Reframe mistakes into learning opportunities. Pinpoint trigger thoughts that cause low self-esteem. Get adventurous and try new things. Own their decisions and opinions. Give back to others through volunteering. Make wise decisions. Support your teen’s growth and development by being generous with praise. This doesn’t mean telling your son or daughter that they’re smart or good-looking. It means diving into specific situations where they performed well (e.g. cleaning their room, getting a B+ on their math test.) Use this descriptive praise to celebrate good choices and hard work. Decision Making and Self-Esteem Decision making remains crucial to a teen’s success. Yet, developing decision-making skills is an often overlooked process. And it requires practice. So, find decision-making opportunities and guide your teen through them.	-0.0042626475915312
295	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_23_941472041-2	How can we, as parents, coaches, advisors and mentors, help lessen that impact?And, most of all, how can we follow these same guidelines to set a good example for our kids? How Social Media Lowers Our Teens’ Self-Esteem: It causes them to live in a world of self promotion No matter what they post, they measure their self-worth on how many “likes” or “comments” the post gets. This turns the posting into an addiction and a determiner of their beauty, worth, popularity and validity. If a post doesn’t get a lot of likes or receives a negative comment they may assume they must be uncool, stupid or not good enough. How to prevent it: Encourage your teenager that their inner beauty, unique qualities and how they treat others are what more important. Help them realize that anyone that measures their worth by their social media profiles, is not a true friend. It makes them constantly compare themselves to others Social media provides a constant outlet for the trap of comparison which subsequently creates feelings of depression and low self-worth in many teens. Pay attention to statements that use “like” and “as” from your teen.	-0.0053456937894225
296	138_1-11	How do I prevent social media from impacting my son's self-esteem?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_25_1467599711-5	Positive Affirmations Day – Observe a positive affirmation day at your home once a week for your teenager to feel confident and affable.This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem. For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts. Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves. Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually. Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth. Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought. Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again. Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem. The following activity, if practiced regularly, will help your teen reduce the cycle of negative self-talk and make them a more positive person. This activity is divided into four sections.	-0.0054352125152945

300	139_1-3	Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?	KILT_35509755-2	"1967 saw Newton's most infamous decision: to not promote Louis Armstrong's recording of the song ""What a Wonderful World"". The song had been written with Armstrong in mind, but when Armstrong, who had recently signed with ABC Records, was recording it, Newton tried to stop the recording session, because he disliked the slow pace. Newton was physically locked out of the studio, and the session continued with him fuming outside. Afterward, Newton put no promotion effort into the single, calling it a mistake. ""What a Wonderful World"" did not do well in the U.S. as a result, though it succeeded elsewhere in the world, including hitting #1 in the UK. It remained essentially unknown in the United States until 20 years later, when it gained popularity after being used in the 1987 film ""Good Morning, Vietnam"".In 1970, Newton became vice-president of ABC Pictures."	-0.0026395025197416

Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong. Newton wanted a swingy pop song like "" Hello, Dolly! "", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with Kapp Records, so when Newton heard the slow pace of ""What a Wonderful World"", he tried to stop the session. Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over. Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure. The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected. To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work. The song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it, but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart."	-0.0032212056685239
302	139_1-3	Why did Larry Newton dislike “What a wonderful world” by Louis Armstrong?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_08_1289547334-7	But Newton was not very excited about the slow-tempo ballad that was “What A Wonderful World.”Newton was opposed to Armstrong doing the song. In fact, he came to the late night recording session and tried to stop it – to the point where he had to be locked out of the studio while the session proceeded. Music arranger/composer Artie Butler shown at work with Louis Armstrong, Las Vegas, Aug 1967. Artie Butler and Louis Armstrong at work in a late-night Las Vegas recording session that was reportedly made easier by Armstrong's good-natured levity. Recordings in those days were done “live” – with vocalist, band or orchestra, and any background vocals all recorded at the same time. A recording session could run through dozens of takes to get everything just right. Overdubbing was still rare then. That night in Las Vegas, however, proved to be very challenging as the session was interrupted twice by the sounds of a coming and going Union Pacific freight train near the studio, blowing its horn. And fuming ABC exec Larry Newton was still locked outside the studio, but making his presence known. The session could have gone bad at the point, given all the interruptions and tension with Newton.	-0.0039137210696935

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures. At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe. Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion. The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures. It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World. It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time. The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers. Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back. The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO. During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives. It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	-0.0020942201372236

Although there its rich biodiversity has endowed it with plenty of natural attractions, the most famous landmark in this Asian country is a manmade marvel. Standing above the skyline of the nation’s capital, the Petronas Twin Towers is the world’s tallest twin towers (451.8 m). They took six years to build and were designed by César Pelli who created this masterpiece using Islamic concepts and geometric forms, including that of the eight-pointed star. The observation decks on the 86th floor of both towers are connected by a bridge and have stunning views over Kuala Lumpur. 5- Marina Bay Sands Another Asian landmark to see is Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. Although Singapore is rich in colonial history, one of the most stunning architectural landmarks in this country is a contemporary building that dominates the skyline. Marina Bay Sands is a modern ‘ship’ in the sky with amazing views of the island city. Not only is it a landmark in Asia to go and see but you can also stay in it as inside, there’s luxurious accommodation, shopping and stunning infinity pools to.	-0.0028024944476783

With a 4000-year-old culture, from palaces and temples to natural wonders, China is home to some of the most impressive landmarks in Asia. It’s a nation that is hurtling towards the future at high speed, with impressive new engineering feats popping up each year. The 500-year-old Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks of Asia and according to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei who orbited in 2003, it can’t be seen from the moon. The structure is a collection of walls, towers, fortresses and barracks stretching 21,196km (13,171 miles). The section of the Great Wall that receives the most visitors are Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing.

318	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_972701974-6	Walking the Great Wall Today Most people who choose to walk the Great Wall of China today choose to walk either a small portion of it, or pick specific, picturesque spots to do a series of connected hikes.This is because many parts of the wall are very run down, and it’s not possible to walk all the way along the top. In the areas close to Beijing, and other tourist hotspots, the Chinese government has invested a significant amount in the upkeep of the wall, making it a very pleasant, if challenging, hike. The most popular parts of the wall lie near to the capital, including Badaling and Mutianyu. Here you are likely to find the wall crammed with tourists in peak season, making it difficult to walk. However, these sections are particularly well-maintained, and set among glorious scenery, with views over the forest. For a day trek, the section between Jinshanling and Simatai is very popular. This section only attracts tour groups at Jinshanling, and once you set off, you’re likely to meet very few people along the way. The wall is crumbling and broken down in places, but remains accessible, and this 11km hike takes you through some of the region’s finest scenery.	-0.0030171608086675
319	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander.Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places. In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders. In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea). The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire. Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier. It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads. Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world. In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	-0.0034344755113124

MARCO_msmarco_doc_58_1517960092-4	Despite its effectiveness, it was sometimes ineffective in keeping enemies out such as in 1644 when the Manchu Qing managed to remove the Ming Dynasty and establish a dynasty of their own.The final construction work done on the wall was back in 1878 in the later phases of the Qing Dynasty, which existed from 1644 to 1911. The construction and maintenance stopped since the wall was rendered obsolete by more advanced weaponry such as fire and explosives. The Great Wall of China Today The Great Wall of China. Image credit: Marc van Vuren/Shutterstock Today, the parts of the wall that are still in good condition were erected or maintained during the Ming Dynasty. Some sections have been renovated in recent times, while others have been destroyed. Some of the best and most widely known sections from the Ming Dynasty include Jinshanling, Simatai, Mutianyu, and Badaling. The Great Wall of China is a popular tourist attraction offering magnificent views, with several sections having been declared 5A-rated tourist attractions, which in the rating categories used by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism means these sections are among the most important and best-maintained tourist destinations of the country.	-0.003572512185201

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_2141211445-21	In addition to rebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu's reign.The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations, and forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone frontages. From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang. Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east. The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian.

An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above riverbank. In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.

Happy holidays! Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well! My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such. It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another. So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities. I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing. The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights. Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	-0.015919491648674

It’s hard not to see the magic. You’ll never be able to see the city in just one visit. It would take years to see everything, but, you can get a good feel of the city in a few days. 4.

The Taj Mahal today is the resting place of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The tombs are the centerpiece of the 17-hectare complex. The Taj Mahal was probably completely built by 1653.

331	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_msmarco_doc_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization.The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan. The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari. Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute. Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well. Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders. This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details. The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	-0.011862214654684

Abu Simbel: You’ll need the Leaders expansion to take advantage of this wonder. You can “bury” leaders for bonus points. Stonehenge: Stonehenge promotes a stone-heavy game, and rewards you for building up heavy stone reserves. Mannekin Pis: This veritable world wonder (the peeing boy statue in Belgium) allows you to copy the benefits of your neighbor’s wonders. Each of these wonders adds a nice little twist and can mix things up if you’ve grown bored of the titular seven wonders that are included with the base game. Overall, it’s a pack that’s worth your money, but it’s at the bottom of our list on the virtue of being an extra accessory more than an actual expansion. Third Place: 7 Wonders: Babel Babel is certainly the most ambitious of the three major 7 Wonders expansions, and that is both its greatest strength and weakness.	-0.0099517377093434

Architects need to make buildings that are friendly to the environment and more green which can be adaptable to the surroundings, in other words, they need to create buildings that are energy efficient, like green buildings or sustainable buildings which are designed to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and nature. So they need to take into consideration: Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources Protecting residents’ health and improving people’s productivity Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation Green buildings ( green architecture) are a trend these days for their positive effect on the environment because they take landscaping into account. Green buildings also managed in the construction process to make sure that any waterways remain unpolluted with construction by-products. Green buildings also have benefits that you’ll find luxury, like better indoor air quality. Many studies have found that they also lend themselves to a better work environment.	-0.0094923824071884

Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"". Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century. The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity. — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"".

The cross of the T is an open-air, covered porch. The porch not only incorporates the open terrace common to other Wright designed buildings of the era but also has an explicit functionality. Wright meant for the porch to be used by those attending funerals while they waited for cars. The placement of the columns on the porch, pulled back from the open corners is found on other Wright buildings such as the Coonley House and the Martin House. The column placement and Wright's drawings may have influenced European architects after 1910 such as, Le Corbusier.

Safety profile Cassava root contains natural toxic cyanogenic glycoside compounds linamarin and methyl-linamarin . Injury to tuber releases linamarase enzyme from the ruptured cells, which then converts linamarin to poisonous hydrocyanic acid (HCN). Therefore, consumption of raw cassava root results in cyanide poisoning with symptoms of vomiting, nausea, dizziness, stomach pains, headache, and death. In general, cyanide content is substantially higher in its outer part and peel. While peeling lessens the cyanide content, sun drying, and soaking followed by boiling in salt-vinegar water results in evaporation of this compound and makes it safe for human consumption.

In spite of the obvious differences among the various local cuisines in this multinational region, the foods display more similarities than differences. The small difference may be in the ingredients used. Most foods are cooked via boiling or frying. Commonly featured, starchy vegetables include yams, plantains, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Rice is also a staple food, as is the Serer people's sorghum couscous (called ""Chereh"" in Serer) particularly in Senegal and the Gambia.

As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/ stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used. To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish. Nigerian and Ghanaian rivalry Due to the differences in regional recipes, the various regions where jollof rice is common are competitive over which variant tastes the best. This is especially prominent between Nigeria and Ghana. These differences have brought about the ""Jollof Wars"" between Nigeria and Ghana.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_37_1107517688-2	Surprisingly, Jollof rice didn’t originate from any of these two noise makers.Ouch! Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish. No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof. The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe. It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta. It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage. Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof. The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne. In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot). The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries. The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights. A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal. Thank God we know better.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_2985927323-2	"In French-speaking areas, it is called riz au gras.Despite the variations, the dish is ""mutually intelligible"" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent. Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire. Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in ""linguistic, historical or political patterns"". Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of ""blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy"" as well as the religion of Islam. Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia."	-0.0034432667307555

Nigerian Jollof is made with long grain parboiled rice. Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria, but imported from Asian countries. A second difference is the method of cooking. The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content. Party Jollof rice, is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations. This dish is legendary for its smoky taste. This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour. A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavour. Ghanian Jollof Rice Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice. Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice. Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell. Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India. The basmati rice is not parboiled. Parboiling makes it soggy.	-0.0141005674377083

The government provided incentives to encourage  domestic and foreign investors to participate in the venture. For  example, the sector was accorded preferred-sector status, qualifying it  for tax holidays and import-duty exemption on tourism-related equipment. Upon the  inauguration of the Third Republic, President Obasanjo accorded the  industry an additional boost by creating a separate Ministry of Tourism  and Culture with Chief Ojo Madueke as its minister. The boost notwithstanding, many impediments stand in the way of a  tourist industry in Nigeria. Warnings issued by foreign governments on  the dangers of travel to Nigeria scare tourists. Violent crime by  individuals in police and military uniforms, as well as by ordinary  criminals, is an acute and constant problem.

Mining Nigeria’s mining sector fell down the global pecking order in 2012 and it hasn’t fully recovered but the private investors interested in exploring the mining sector might just help boost it back provided Reform Policies and Opaque business ethics don’t cripple it off. Electricity Nigeria’s electricity production hasn’t been much to write home about, since the consumption continues to weigh down production. Nigeria consumes an estimate of 18 billion Kilowatts and the production is way insufficient to have power supply on a regular. Services Nigeria ranks 63rd worldwide and fifth in Africa in services output. Low power generation has crippled the growth of this sector. Economic growth from services output remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, crime threats and associated need for security counter measures, non-transparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting. Other sectors have also contributed their tits and bits to economic development in Nigeria but no matter how ridiculously easy it sounds, there needs to be serious policy restructure, transparency in public-private partnership, and a change of mentality and attitude.	-0.0064985142089426

MARCO_msmarco_doc_14_666207898-18	When trying to make money with Bitcoin using BTC faucets, it is very important to watch out for scams or “dead faucets”.A good rule of thumb is to avoid faucets without an active social media presence. 16. Lend your Bitcoins If you already own some Bitcoin and are open to taking some risk, then making money with Bitcoin lending might be interesting to you. As in traditional lending also, Bitcoin lending consists in lending your Bitcoin to a third party, usually through a lending platform, at an interest. This interest is usually magnitudes higher than in traditional banking since the market is unregulated, and risk is significantly higher. Some lending platforms pay up to 20% yearly interest. That being said, you should never lend more Bitcoin than what you can afford to lose. There have been several cases of Bitcoin lending platforms that defaulted or that were straight up ponzi schemes, and lenders ended up losing all of their money. One notorious platform was Bitconnect, which promised guaranteed returns of up to 2% per day by supposedly using the money that you lent them to “trade digital currencies and make significant profits”. When Bitconnect collapsed in early 2018, lenders lost all their money and countless lives were permanently destroyed.	-0.0405024997889995

Example of Ponzi schemes in India are Emu scheme : In case of the emu Ponzi scheme an investor was supposed to rear emus and then sell their meat, oil, etc. Speak Asia : In order to become a member of Speak Asia one had to invest Rs 11,000 and subscribe to the electronic magazine issued by the company called Surveys Today.

Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ). Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse. Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	-0.0022243538405746

Ponzi schemes Source = Drwealth What is it? Named after swindler & con artist Charles Ponzi, a Ponzi scheme (or Ponzi game) is a fraudulent investment operation wherein the operator or individual pays its initial investors from the funds that he raises from later investors rather than the profit earned through legal sources. The operators of this scheme most often attract investors by offering short-term and higher returns than other investments. No matter what the initial situation, the continuation of high returns and scheme requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors. In 1920, Charles Ponzi became infamous for using the technique. His original scheme was based on the arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps. He diverted the money of later investors to make payments to himself and his initial investors. Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme: When the scheme isn’t stopped by authorities, it collapses due to one of the following reasons: When the promoter disappears by taking away all the remaining investment money. As the scheme requires continuous investments for funding higher returns, so once the investment gets slowed down and the scheme collapses since the promoter faces problems in paying the promised returns.	-0.0035246410407125

As soon as this system collapses, the owners envelop the same scam under the umbrella of another name and relaunch it. You might be wondering why it is so easy for the owners to mask a scam under another name. Simple. The SEC shuts these programs down after they have determined a huge percentage of their revenue comes from the sale of adPacks and recruitment. It takes a reasonable time span (months or years) for the SEC to have a proper analysis of the program’s income statements and then confirm they are operating illegally. If you want to disregard my personal grudge with RevShare programs, that is fine. Here is what the SEC had to say about Profit Clicking and another huge RevShare program, Traffic Monsoon.

Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run. External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended. Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate. The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.

Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing). Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.BULLET::::3. External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008), cause many investors to withdraw part or all of their funds.Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate. The amounts that investors thought they had, were never attainable in the first place.	-0.0037745437584817

MARCO_msmarco_doc_36_840746247-2	A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud whereby crooks steal money from investors and mask the theft by funneling returns to clients from funds contributed by newer investors.Bernard Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a $65 billion scam encompassing thousands of investors that was uncovered in 2008. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release. Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds. In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.

Low start-up costs High start-up costs Legitimate Illegal Ponzi schemes You may have also heard of Ponzi Scheme s, which are closely related to pyramid schemes. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation. Rather than pay investors from profits earned by the individual or organization, the organization pays investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors. The payments tend to be very high, but to keep the high returns going, there would need to be an infinite flow of money from new investors. So, much like pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes inevitably collapse when they run out of new investors. How can you avoid the pyramid scheme trap? Ask lots of questions before you sign-up.

But BTC has boomed, and busted, massively multiple times - each time making a new high at the top and each time bottoming higher than prior bottoms (and the prior starting point for the boom). Increased adoption IS what makes this more valuable. That doesn't make this a ponzi scheme anymore than Facebook is. It's the growth of the network that provides the value. And owning the BTC is what involves you in the network.

Beginning in 1986, Slatkin ran a Ponzi scheme for fifteen years, through an unlicensed “investment club,” where he promised a 24% return. He stole $592 million from nearly 800 people, guilty of 15 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering. Many of Slatkin’s victims were also Scientologists and includes news anchor, Greta Van Susteren and Pearl Harbor producer, Armyan Bernstein. Slatkin served his sentence and was released from a half-way house, in July 2013. 1 Bernie Madoff Bernie Madoff is presumably the most famous Ponzi schemer, other than Ponzi himself, operating the largest fraud in US history. Madoff stole $65 billion from investors and committed over 11 federal felonies. Madoff lived a flashy, luxurious life by most standards, but less so than, for example, Scott Rothstein. Madoff received the maximum sentence of 150 years in prison, which he is currently serving in Raleigh, North Carolina.

The APY is the most important detail in the email. But there are a few subtle points that also merit discussion. Payment frequency: interest paid monthly This is a very important detail. This tells you the bank only credits the interest to your account once a month on a specified day. It helps to know when the interest is paid, especially if you are closing the account. You can lose out on interest if you close out just before a payment. For instance, if you expect an interest payment of say $50 on the 15th of the month, but you happen to close the account on the 14th, then you would lose out on that $50. In the account mentioned in the email, we expect to earn $2.50 a year, so that comes out to about 20 cents each month paid on a specific day. Balance calculation: daily collected balances This is another important detail.

When you take out a loan there is always some level of risk involved — whether you have bad credit or not. However, if you take out a bad credit loan, the risks can be a bit more steep. Beware of scammers and predatory lenders in particular. Predatory lenders specifically go after those who have a hard time getting loans, so it’s best to always do research on a lender offering bad credit loans. Those taking out bad credit loans should also be aware that if they default on a loan, the lender can seize your collateral. This can result in an even bigger toll on your credit score, so be sure you’re in a stable position to pay off any loan you take out. Super high interest rates are another risk. If your credit score is very bad, you may be offered a loan with a sky-high interest rate — which can sometimes be as high as 200% or 300%. Unless you’re in dire need of cash, you may want to steer clear of those loans. They’ll be tough to pay off, and there’s a lot at risk if you can’t.	-0.0896652340888977

If you are a foreigner, you are expected to pay cash in full for purchasing real estate. Expatriates who generate an income abroad are not required to pay tax when they transfer the funds into Argentina. Many employers will tell you that you do not need a work visa to work for them.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_10_1345225280-2	Most American versions of whipped cream add both sugar and vanilla to the cream, which is essentially the same thing.This cream is credited to the chef Francois Vatel. At the Chateau de Chantilly, Vatel supervised a huge banquet for Louis XIV and a reported 2,000 guests, where he created the now famous cream for use in pastries. Sadly, Vatel would not be able to enjoy the cream's later popularity; his despair over the slow cooking of the fish resulted in him committing suicide later that night. Most Americans know Chantilly cream as whipped cream. The creation of Chantilly cream is thus tainted by Vatel’s suicide. Yet few remember its origins, or if they do, prepare the cream because of its popularity, and as a way to honor the terribly misguided genius of Vatel. Today, it is used throughout Europe in various pastries like eclairs, cream puffs, and it also may top ice cream. In the US, Chantilly cream is relatively standard. American cooks may also use the cream in French or Italian inspired pastries, or to top, fill, or frost numerous types of cakes. The Fruit Basket cake, a golden cake, is layered with fruit and cream, and generally also frosted with the whipped cream.	-0.0465444214642047

It’s a special team, Argentina.” Messi was most special. He was blinding and brilliant, the conductor of an attack that toyed with its overmatched and undermanned foes for extended stretches. Three minutes into the match, he assisted on Ezequiel Lavezzi’s goal by delicately chipping the ball with one touch into the penalty area. Messi’s 32nd-minute strike all but settled matters. Gonzalo Higuain converted the rebound of his own saved shot early in the second half, and Messi set up Higuain’s goal in the 86th as Argentina increased its tournament scoring margin to 18-2.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_01_704783737-30	Some things they say are nice compliments which are not offensive at all.And some were outrageously disgusting. One time I was walking with my dad and this gay said something to me so offensive that my dad almost beat him up (I was about 17 years old). Things have changed now quite a bit. Most men have learned to be more respectful and they keep their comments to themselves. Some do not say anything that is not solicited. And a few will still say what-ever. Argentine women do not pay attention to such comments at all. They ignore them completely. Some women answer back with expletives (not many however). As a woman, I do like to receive comments (nice ones obviously). And here in the United States, MEN DO NOT SAY ANYTHING AT ALL for fear of repercussion. Then women here complain that men do not notice them! So, my advice is this: Argentina is a country rich in culture, history and it is full of life and vibrancy. Not to mention its natural beauty. Each person's experience whether black or white will be different because each one of us is different. We speak differently, we carry ourselves differently because each one of us is UNIQUE.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners.In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real. This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers. Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell. All this led to a sharp reduction in exports. As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998. Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy. In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket. Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime. As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	-0.0036121853627264

WAPO_XWC7DVRLCUI6TMAR3BIAMRG4TA-2	Laura Catena, Nicolas’s daughter, now manages the winery and is pushing the exploration of Mendoza’s altitudes, especially in the Uco Valley, south of the city. But it was her father’s intuition about the mountains that set the stage for things to come. Here’s Argentina’s secret: Every additional 100 meters (about 328 feet) of altitude decreases the average temperature by 1 degree Celsius. That means grapes with higher acidity and softer tannins. But the intensity of the sunlight increases as well, allowing the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness while the cooler temperatures keep the sugars in check. The combination of low temperatures and high-intensity sun yields red wines of high intensity and extraction, soft and almost imperceptible tannins, and impressive structure and balance. Altitude is only one factor in Argentina’s reach for quality. “Our wines are wines of the sun, but also of the soil,” says Sebastian Zuccardi, third-generation winemaker at Familia Zuccardi in Mendoza.	-0.0037162308581173

MARCO_msmarco_doc_10_1319314585-2	The cooling effect of           altitude means that the grapes preserve acidity even when they are           allowed to hang for quite a while before harvest.But it would be wrong to dismiss Argentina’s other           wine regions. Two in particular are worth mentioning. First, Salta. Up           in the hot north, these are the world’s highest commercial           vineyards: were it not for the effect of altitude, it would be too hot           for quality viticulture here. Second, Patagonia. Travelling far south,           this is a cooler, windier, flatter region that’s beginning to turn           out some really nice wines. This tasting covered 45 different Malbecs, which sounds           like a lot, but is only a quick sampling of a much broader offering. Some important wines are missing – Catena, Achaval Ferrer and Colomé,           to name but three – and so this can’t be seen as a true ranking of           Argentina’s best. In terms of quality, I though this was quite high           across the board. Remember, this is a mixture of commercial wines and           then some high-end ones. Stylistically, I think Argentina would do           well to go down the road of freshness, definition and structure,           rather than super-ripeness and new oak flavours.	-0.0043961787596344

MARCO_msmarco_doc_54_1821438646-9	The truth is, they each have different things to offer, and if you’re going to make the effort to go the falls in the first place, you really should see both sides.Allow yourself two full days just for exploring both sides of the falls. If you want to visit any other attractions in the area, such as the Itaipú Dam or Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, factor in an additional day for that. How to Get to Iguazu Falls You have three options for visiting the falls: (1) tour Iguazu falls on your own by public transport; (2) go on an all-inclusive tour of Iguazu falls; or (3) take private transportation, but without a tour guide. In my view, Iguazu tours are completely unnecessary and take all the fun out of exploring the falls on your own. Large tour groups also clog up the pathways and can ruin the experience for other visitors, so I do not recommend this option. If you’re staying in Foz do Iguaçu, it’s easy to reach the Brazilian side of the falls by taking the No. 120 public bus, which runs between the city, the airport and the falls.

It is on the expensive side, but it is the only hotel in the National Park and by staying here, you have access to the trails along the falls and the catwalk leading into the horseshoe at sunrise and sunset. 12. Iguazu Falls From Restaurant Footpath Things to do in Iguassu Falls There is an excellent viewing point at the main restaurant where you can see them from above, plus take an elevator or footpath down to the catwalk to see them up close. Iguassu National Park opens at 8:00 am and closes at 5pm, so if you are not staying at the hotel, you have no chance of witnessing sunrise or sunset over the falls. We were out at the crack of dawn and until after dusk exploring Iguassu Falls virtually on our own. We only saw one or two other people at the falls so we were free to photograph and explore in solitude. It was an incredible experience.	-0.0054071126505732

Protective rain suits are provided. There are some areas where it is possible to swim in the spray of the cascades, too. Sightsee by boat: Iguazu Falls are packed with adventurous activities from zip lining to a ""Green Train"" that goes through the jungle, but perhaps the most exciting is riding in a boat at the base of the falls. Jet boats departing from the Circuito Inferior and Puerto Macuco go right into San Martin—prepare to get drenched. Get an aerial view: If you'd rather marvel at the natural wonder from above instead, consider a helicopter ride.

Traders of the time, however, were penalized by the complexity of the approved trading routes (which benefitted Lima, Peru) and by the later part of the 19th century, began to promote the idea of independence from the Spanish crown.	-0.0061100833117961

With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city. Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities. The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land. Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country. The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs. These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world. The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	-0.0102104237303137

Open banking is a concept in financial services based on several principles: the use of open APIs allowing third party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions, increased financial transparency options for account holders and the use of open source technology to achieve these principles. Using APIs means that banking data will be available in real-time, providing consumers with better ways to conduct transactions, save and invest their money. Consumers may also have access to better loan terms since lenders will be able to look at historical transactional data to determine a borrower’s risk level. Open Banking also aims to give consumers better and more personalized information for making sound financial decisions. Around the world there are pressures, both regulatory and customer-led, that are opening up the financial services market to new entrants and disrupting what and how customers buy. In Europe, the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is set to unleash a transformation in how financial services organizations view themselves and each other. In the United States, aggregators such as Mint.com have already dis-intermediated banks and now own the ‘last mile’ of the customer banking relationship, disrupting traditional players.	-0.0032734877895563

MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_1186259104-6	Open APIs let banks easily integrate their services with third-party platforms, apps, and products.Open banking also makes cross-border expansion easier. Lower operational costs. Another benefit is cutting operational costs, as banks can spend less time supporting foreign subsidiaries providing some services directly from the home market. Higher competition. Customers will benefit from increased competition in the financial industry as prices will go down and service quality will go up. For example, customers will be able to use financial services aggregators to compare offers from banks and other institutions. They’ll also get remote access to a number of products that used to be available in branches only. Added value from third parties. Third parties can access banking data, allowing them to design new products, innovate, and create additional value for bank customers. As trust in non-bank payment providers grows, open banking provides such companies with a number of opportunities in the financial services market.

Early “open banking” projects were scraping data from shared sources, but the records were often incomplete and provided only a partial picture. These projects were difficult and expensive to support: If a bank decided to redesign its application, scraping became impossible. Open banking APIs solve that problem by providing access to standardized data in a secure manner. Payment Services Directive Explained So, what is PSD2? The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a legal framework that regulates payment services through the EU and EEA (European Economic Area). The directive supports innovation and development of an integrated payment market across Europe. The new regulatory document was adopted in October 2015. It was a logical extension of the original PSD, which was designed in 2007 to increase competition across the payment industry. The new directive is focused on making cross-border payments easy and secure. PSD2 integrates open banking and APIs with the financial business industry ecosystem.

It is anticipated that both aggregation and payment services will be offered by third parties to Barclay Group's customers and Barclays Group itself has launched an aggregation service. PSD2 will also introduce new requirements to the authentication process for a number of actions customers take, including ecommerce transactions. A failure to comply with Open Banking requirements could expose Barclays Group to regulatory sanction. Further, the data sharing regime could mean that actions or omissions by third-party service providers could expose Barclays Group to potential financial loss from third-party fraud, misuse of customer data, litigation and reputational detriment, amongst other things.

552	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-3	Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches.Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking. However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs. If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals. Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models. So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed. Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation. This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives. But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data. This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking. The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.	-0.002088390989229
553	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-17	US banks can use open banking to recalibrate customer relationships by giving customers control of their data and helping them more easily and confidently engage with third parties for a variety of services.Shifting to open banking may require banks to partner with a broader ecosystem of providers, but banks can still stay at the center of customers’ financial lives by remaining trusted advisers in these arrangements. How US banks respond to the open banking wave could inform and shape their digital transformation strategies as well. By inserting customers at the heart of the transformation in open banking and beyond, banks can build trust and ensure they remain in a position of strength. However, there are still some uncertainties about the scale and pace of adoption of open banking in the United States. Should banks fully embrace open banking and accelerate their adoption, or should they be more selective in choosing where to play, or perhaps even wait to see what happens before making a choice? Each approach has its pros and cons (figure 8). Going “all-in” may yield a first-mover advantage, but exposing the institution to open banking on all fronts, for all products, customer groups, and with all types of third parties all at once may increase some risks.	-0.0023932405747473
554	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_59_690617273-16	Banks may want to choose partner institutions that have already engendered a lot of customer trust, including other banks.Banks should also work with regulators to foster common industry standards for APIs. They should ensure that other regulations related to data security or customer privacy do not inhibit the development and growth of a market-driven open banking approach. US banks should be selective in their open banking strategies As highlighted in other publications by Deloitte, 16 open banking seems here to stay and is quickly gaining ground outside the United States. More and more consumers are taking advantage of open banking developments in the United Kingdom and Europe, 17 and progress has been made on technical standards. While it may be premature for leaders from these banks to point to open banking as a key driver of innovation and competitive advantage, the foundation has been set. In the United States, on the other hand, open banking is in the early stages, which presents an unprecedented opportunity, especially for early adopters. Here, open banking, along with the broader digital transformation journey that many banks around the world have taken, can help enable the shift from a product mindset to a singular focus on serving customer needs.	-0.0038200279232114
555	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_419159361-14	This not only suggests to organizations that there is little revenue potential, but it also mean that it would be expensive to develop such a market.Consequently, relatively few organizations invest in and experiment with new products based on the new technology brought about through technological discontinuity. For example, When Amazon started selling books online Barnes and Nobles and other brick and mortar booksellers discounted the new technology model and now Barnes and Nobles may be on the brink of bankruptcy. Barnes and Nobles, Borders and other bookseller also believe that not many books will want to buy books online. How can you buy what you have not seen? The banking industry is also another example. Although on-line technology has existed for some time, until recently on-line product innovation in the banking industry has been slow in coming. One cause has been the difficulty in adapting banking to on-line technology. Banks have to develop user software application, terminal equipment, and sophisticated communications facilities to mesh the technology into a product that consumers could easily use and also be able to have enough security built into the applications to protect users and bank’s asset. Banks probably also believed that consumers would want personal contact with a human banker, due to the relative complexity and risk associated with financial products.	-0.0027970261871814

MARCO_msmarco_doc_29_1537139190-7	For the first time time, the banking industry can consolidate all internal and external data, building predictive profiles of customers and members in real time.With consumer data that is rich, accessible and financially viable to deploy, financial institutions of all sizes can not only know their customers, but also provide advice for the future. This enhanced use of data will enhance the consumer experience, while increasing security and efficiency. By moving from a rear-view-mirror perspective of customer communication to services deployed by robo-advisors and AI-driven chatbots, financial institutions will provide consumers with value through ‘next-best actions’ as opposed to blind selling of products. The real innovation will occur when financial institutions integrate this capability with the expanded services of open banking and connected devices. The reach of banks and credit unions can be expanded as virtual agents work on behalf of the consumer to find the best mix of solutions for each individual in real time. This transformation may also result in the elimination of specific traditional products (checking, loans, payments) with the emergence of universal cash management solutions that address all needs in an integrated service.	-0.0036381976678967

In combination to energy policy measures, China has consistently attempted to enact financial regulations on cryptocurrencies. Notably, The People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, implemented measures prohibiting domestic Bitcoin exchanges and banning the practice of raising public funds for the development new cryptocurrencies. Historically, China’s financial regulatory measures correlate with depreciations in Bitcoin’s value, most notably in 2014 when the price of Bitcoin in China fell more than 50% from its peak after the release the 2013 Bitcoin Notice. [ 15] Due to China’s high crypto-mining production rate, prominence of mining companies, and considerable level of Bitcoin transactions, a regulatory crackdown there carries the potential to impact the global cryptocurrency market. However, instead of closing operations, we see mining operations transition to locations in North America and Northern European countries with looser regulatory environments and physical environments that favor the cost of crypto-mining production.	-0.005747222341597

The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions. Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.” The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [ cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.” While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	-0.0016237420495599

The EU is one jurisdiction that appears to lack a clear focus when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations. The top administration of the union has been giving mixed signals on the direction that should be followed. The EU Central Bank was the first to fire the salvo by indicating that cryptocurrencies were highly volatile and risked causing huge losses. It required the citizens to be extra cautious because the cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and could end up being hot bubbles. However, the EU Parliament had a different view altogether. The legislative arm of the EU indicated that cryptocurrencies represented the apex of the fintech and could not be simply wished away. Instead, the parliament recommended comprehensive studies on cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin before a legal framework to regulate them gets installed. On its part, the commission leadership is in agreement with the EU Central bank that the threats from cryptocurrencies are too dire to be left unattended. The EU Commission Vice President, Valdis Dombrovskis, indicated that the risks associated with cryptocurrencies were clear. According to the commission, these dangers include price volatility, the risk of complete loss, security failures and massive liability gaps.	-0.001911956933327

In an effort to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorism financing, the regulations aim to tackle the anonymity of digital coins. As a result, crypto exchanges and wallet providers will be required to register with authorities and introduce customer due diligence procedures, including identity verification. As for what the future holds, we can find some clues in a July 2018 report from the EU’s Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies entitled “Virtual currencies and central banks monetary policy: challenges ahead”. Referring to cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies (VCs), the report states that: “Policy makers and regulators should not ignore VCs, nor should they attempt to ban them.

In the aftermath of these hacks, the price of particular cryptocurrencies has dropped considerably. In a bid to counter the activities of these cybercriminals, traders and platform operators have to take a number of precautionary measures. While some of these measures are indeed helpful, they create bottlenecks that hamper the cryptocurrency trading process. This then creates a trade-off between security and efficiency. Take for instance, the need to provide adequate security for cryptocurrency held in wallet storage. Due to the activities of hackers, some traders prefer to store the bulk of their cryptocurrency holdings in offline wallets. This means that anytime they wish to trade, they have to move from offline storage to online storage before participating in the trade. This constitutes another hassle in an already convoluted trading environment. Transactions on a blockchain are immutable and as such if funds get stolen, there is little chance of ever recovering such funds.

588	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine. Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine. No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel. The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel. Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets. But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor. So why does SpaceX use Methane? It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX has developed the Raptor. It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine. The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket. No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets. SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket. The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	-0.0008837846689857
589	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets. | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets. SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel. However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant. So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene? SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines. And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature. It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets. When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars. However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable. So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	-0.0013673489447683

MARCO_msmarco_doc_02_1714454800-8	SpaceX has traditionally favored dense, easy to handle propellant (LOX/RP1) and simple engine designs (the Merlin is a simple gas generator cycle, rather than the more efficient[ but more complex] staged combustion design used by most other modern rockets). As such, it makes sense that they would go for the easier to handle and simpler solution of a methane rocket rather than the high performance but difficult and complicated liquid hydrogen motor, so long as the methane provides them with the performance that they require (which will remain to be seen).

591	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket.Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth. It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks. Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof. Methane does not have this leak issue. Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4). As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks. Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues. When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed. Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets. When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor. In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost. Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine. Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	-0.0020823241211473

MARCO_msmarco_doc_22_1412821537-2	This risk increases if you purchase a cheap imitation of a real Hho car conversion kit.Cheap imitations are easy to spot because they are made from lower quality parts, such as cheap PVC materials and the use of water bottles rather than steel containers. These don't stand up well to the temperature changes and constant jarring of on-road use, which can cause them to crack and break. Also, they are often tricky to install, do not easily adapt from petrol to diesel engines and produce less hydrogen for the price, while reputable manufacturers provide high quality, adaptable generators. One liter of hydrogen per minute represents an acceptable performance. Faulty Electrical Wiring If a car gas saver is wired incorrectly, there is the risk of fire and explosion created by sparks or moisture getting onto the faulty wiring. There also is the possibility that other electrical components will suffer interference from the generator, which could create hazards during driving. Flammability It must be remembered that Hho is a flammable gas, which makes it great for fuel efficiency proposals but highly dangerous.

It weighs approximately 4.6 ounces while the propellant weighs approximately 2.2 ounces. Even though it is not considered a high power model rocket engine, it could launch a rocket like the Apogee Aspire, which is built for altitude, well over 4,000 feet into the air. When Engine Size Doesn’t Matter In general, a larger and heavier motor will be more powerful because there will be more fuel inside of it, but this is not always true. There are two different types of model rocket engines commonly used to launch model rockets of all kinds. The model rocket engine most people are familiar with is the black powder engines, which were the first model rocket engines sold widely. Since the 1980s another model rocket engine has been gaining in popularity, especially for high power model rocketry, and that is the composite engine. One of the most important differences between these two types of engines is that the fuel in composite engines offers more power in smaller packages than the fuel in black powder engines.	-0.004954561125487

You can find detailed information here for low and high orbits, etc. Falcon Heavy - Wikipedia A good way to compare rockets is to first restrict your search to those which can carry the payload you have, then look at cost and reliability numbers. Mithur Sheridan , Passionate with Space travel Answered December 22, 2020 · Author has 4.4K answers and 5.9M answer views Exactly the same as any other rocket. When you are in orbit, height and velocity are roughly the same. That is, if you are in a lower orbit, you are going faster; and if you are in a higher orbit, you are going progressively slower. At the same orbit (let’s say, 350Km, one of the lowest orbits you can achieve) both the most older Titan and the most modern Falcon 9 go at the same velocity. And both, the older and newest orbital rocket go to orbit at exactly the same general speed: as fast as the atmosphere allows (which is generally slower than the speed the rocket could achieve).	-0.028552396222949

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_2016179054-2	"We can specify a time-averaged thrust of the engine by adding up the product of the thrust over some small time increment times the amount of the time increment and then dividing by the total time.The result of this averaging is shown by the dashed lines on the plot. When purchasing model rocket engines, you will notice a label on each engine in the format; letter number - number. On the figure, we show a C6-4. The first number indicates the average thrust in Newtons. A C6-4 has an average thrust of 6 Newtons. The average thrust times the burn time of the engine is called the total impulse of the engine. The letter gives the maximum total impulse of that class of engine. An ""A"" engine has a maximum impulse of 2.5 Newton-seconds, a ""1/2A"" has 1.25 N-sec, a ""B"" has 5.0 N-sec, a ""C"" has 10.0 N-sec, and a ""D"" has 20.0 N-sec. If we compare the curves for B6 and the C6, we find that both engines have the same average thrust (6 Newtons), but the ""C"" engine burns almost twice as long for double the total impulse."	-0.0364645235240459

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_2015988874-4	"Two different rocket engines have different values of specific impulse.The engine with the higher value of specific impulse is more efficient because it produces more thrust for the same amount of propellant. Third, it simplifies our mathematical analysis of rocket thermodynamics. The units of specific impulse are the same whether we use English units or metric units. Fourth, it gives us an easy way to ""size"" an engine during preliminary analysis. The result of our thermodynamic analysis is a certain value of specific impulse. The rocket weight will define the required value of thrust. Dividing the thrust required by the specific impulse will tell us how much weight flow of propellants our engine must produce. This information determines the physical size of the engine. There is a similar efficiency parameter called the specific thrust which is used to characterize turbine engine performance.

The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets. Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing. However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult. The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.

621	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship. SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine. Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine. No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel. The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel. Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets. But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor. So why does SpaceX use Methane? It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX has developed the Raptor. It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine. The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket. No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets. SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket. The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	-0.0008837846689857

SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel. However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant. So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene? SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines. And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature. It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2). It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar. Let’s elaborate. SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets. When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars. However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable. So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX.

As such, it makes sense that they would go for the easier to handle and simpler solution of a methane rocket rather than the high performance but difficult and complicated liquid hydrogen motor, so long as the methane provides them with the performance that they require (which will remain to be seen).

624	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket.Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth. It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks. Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof. Methane does not have this leak issue. Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4). As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks. Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues. When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed. Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets. When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor. In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost. Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine. Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	-0.0020823241211473

MARCO_msmarco_doc_22_1412821537-2	This risk increases if you purchase a cheap imitation of a real Hho car conversion kit.Cheap imitations are easy to spot because they are made from lower quality parts, such as cheap PVC materials and the use of water bottles rather than steel containers. These don't stand up well to the temperature changes and constant jarring of on-road use, which can cause them to crack and break. Also, they are often tricky to install, do not easily adapt from petrol to diesel engines and produce less hydrogen for the price, while reputable manufacturers provide high quality, adaptable generators. One liter of hydrogen per minute represents an acceptable performance. Faulty Electrical Wiring If a car gas saver is wired incorrectly, there is the risk of fire and explosion created by sparks or moisture getting onto the faulty wiring. There also is the possibility that other electrical components will suffer interference from the generator, which could create hazards during driving.

Black powder model rocket engines are made of a paper tube with a clay nozzle, a solid pellet of black powder propellant, a smoke/delay charge, and an ejection charge as shown in this figure. Cut-away design of a model rocket engine. Booster engines are similar but lack the Smoke/Delay and ejection charge. A model rocket engine is ignited by inserting an igniter in the clay nozzle putting it in contact with the propellant. At launch, an electric current is driven through the igniter, causing it so explode, igniting the propellant. An engine with an igniter inserted in the engine nozzle."	-0.0017952292691916

Your rocket floats to the ground. Time to go find it! Are there different types of model rocket engines? Most model rocket engines consist of a solid propellant, designed for one-time use. However, there are multiple types of model rocket engines. To learn more about model rocket engines, you should explore single-use vs. reloadable engines, liquid vs. solid fuel, black powder vs. composite engines, and different model rocket engine brands. Single Use vs. Reloadable There are three types of model rocket engine motors: single-use, loadable, and reloadable. Here are the pros and cons to each of them. Single-Use Model Rocket Engine More expensive overall Easier to assemble and use Usually what you find in hobby shops No age requirement or restriction Loadable Model Rocket Engine Close in price to single-use model rocket engines Assembly required and trickier than single-use engines Composite propellant only (more on this later) Age 18+ only Reloadable Model Rocket Engine Lower cost per flight Assembly required with more steps than other engines Usually requires special order (not found in hobby shops)	-0.0045285052619874
632	144_2-11	Tell me about the different types of rocket engines.	MARCO_msmarco_doc_30_74918479-8	The Aerotech G80T-13 is one of the most powerful model rocket engines that you can purchase without a certification.It is a 29 mm single use composite engine with a total impulse of 136.6 Newton seconds. It weighs approximately 4.6 ounces while the propellant weighs approximately 2.2 ounces. Even though it is not considered a high power model rocket engine, it could launch a rocket like the Apogee Aspire, which is built for altitude, well over 4,000 feet into the air. When Engine Size Doesn’t Matter In general, a larger and heavier motor will be more powerful because there will be more fuel inside of it, but this is not always true. There are two different types of model rocket engines commonly used to launch model rockets of all kinds. The model rocket engine most people are familiar with is the black powder engines, which were the first model rocket engines sold widely. Since the 1980s another model rocket engine has been gaining in popularity, especially for high power model rocketry, and that is the composite engine. One of the most important differences between these two types of engines is that the fuel in composite engines offers more power in smaller packages than the fuel in black powder engines.	-0.004954561125487

639	144_2-17	Why do open cycle rocket engines exhaust fuel?	KILT_51669100-0	Electric-pump-fed engineThe electric-pump-fed engine is a bipropellant rocket engine in which the fuel pumps are electrically powered, and so all of the input propellant is directly burned in the main combustion chamber, and none is diverted to drive the pumps. This differs from traditional rocket engine designs, in which the pumps are driven by a portion of the input propellants.An electric cycle engine uses electric pumps to pressurize the propellants from a low-pressure fuel tank to high-pressure combustion chamber levels, generally from to . The pumps are powered by an electric motor, with electricity from a battery bank.Electrical pump had been used in the secondary propulsion system of the Agena upper stage vehicle.As of January 2018, the only rocket engines to use electric propellant pump systems are the Rutherford engine, nine of which power the Electron rocket, and the electric pump-fed rocket engine used in sounding rockets developed by Astra Space (formerly Ventions).	-0.0150580611079931

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_3581844498-20	Electric pump-fed An electric motor, generally a brushless DC electric motor, drives the pumps.The electric motor is powered by a battery pack. It is relatively simple to implement and reduces the complexity of the turbomachinery design, but at the expense of the extra dry mass of the battery pack. Example engine is the Rutherford. Gas-generator cycle A small percentage of the propellants are burnt in a preburner to power a turbopump and then exhausted through a separate nozzle, or low down on the main one. This results in a reduction in efficiency since the exhaust contributes little or no thrust, but the pump turbines can be very large, allowing for high power engines. Examples: Saturn V 's F-1 and J-2, Delta IV 's RS-68, Ariane 5 's HM7B, Falcon 9 's Merlin. Tap-off cycle Takes hot gases from the main combustion chamber of the rocket engine and routes them through engine turbopump turbines to pump propellant, then is exhausted. Since not all propellant flows through the main combustion chamber, the tap-off cycle is considered an open-cycle engine. Examples include the J-2S and BE-3. Expander cycle Cryogenic fuel (hydrogen, or methane) is used to cool the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle.	-0.0174076091498136

The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets. Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing. However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult. The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first. Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage. Falcon Heavy at the Cape pic.twitter.com/hizfDVsU7X — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2017 Based on Musk’s photos, all the rocket is missing is the payload. SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board. Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking. Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though. The Falcon heavy launch is currently scheduled for some time in January, which is not an optimal Mars transfer timeframe, by the way.	-0.0133756697177886

KILT_4348888-3	A first design of the Falcon Heavy included a unique propellant crossfeed capability, where fuel and oxidizer to power most of the engines on the center core would be fed from the two side cores, up until the side cores would be near empty and ready for the first separation event. However, due to its extreme complexity this feature was cancelled in 2015 leaving each of the three cores to burn its own fuel.Like the single stick Falcon 9, each Falcon Heavy booster core is reusable. The Falcon Heavy Test Flight demonstrated the two side boosters landing simultaneously near their launch site, while the central booster attempted a landing on SpaceX's Autonomous spaceport drone ship, which resulted in a hard landing near the ship. During the second mission all three boosters landed softly. A Falcon Heavy launch that succeeds in recovering all three core boosters has the same material expenditure as the Falcon 9, i.e. the upper stage and potentially the payload fairing.	-0.0139655042439699

Recovery of second stages and fairings Despite public statements that they would endeavor to make the Falcon 9 second-stage reusable as well, by late 2014, SpaceX determined that the mass needed for a re-entry heat shield, landing engines, and other equipment to support recovery of the second stage was at that time prohibitive, and indefinitely suspended their second-stage reusability plans for the Falcon line. However, in 2017, they indicated that they might do experimental tests on recovering one or more second-stages to learn more about reusability to inform their new, much-larger, Starship launch vehicle development process.	-0.0231905877590179

The large heat shield and wings added a lot of weight, so the Shuttle's incredibly powerful engines—comparable to a Saturn V moon rocket—were mostly used to lift the Shuttle itself. Worse, the weight forced the Shuttle to use solid-fuel rocket boosters which couldn't be turned off in an emergency. And the Shuttle ended up needing extensive, expensive refurbishment every time it flew. The result was that, in practice, a Shuttle mission wasn't any cheaper than an expendable rocket with a similar payload. And worst of all, this complexity ended up making the Shuttle unsafe. Challenger was destroyed during launch by a defect in one of the dangerous solid-fuel rocket boosters. Columbia was destroyed during reentry because some of the fragile heat tiles, damaged during launch, failed to protect the spacecraft. In each case, seven astronauts were on board the Shuttle; all perished.	-0.0025094230659306

But the collapse of the USSR ended that programme. When the Venture Star programme was de-funded for lack of progress NASA had no choice but to extend the operational life of the Space Shuttle fleet which by now was the only way Americans could get to space. The ISS was a way to peacefully integrate Russian plans for Mir 2 and the American Spacestation Freedom. Building the ISS and operating the shuttle used up almost all of NASA budget so there was no money for anything else. After the loss of Columbia, it was crystal clear that the Shuttle programme should end and whilst it completed the tasks set out for it constructing the station, it was retIred afterwards.

Reusable rockets are only valuable if the frequency of launches is great enough to outweigh the cost of developing and utilizing the technology. It would have been silly to waste Apollo project funds trying to make the Saturn V reusable. Only about a dozen launches of the Saturn V were planned, so it was cheaper to use a disposable launch vehicle. When it came time for the Space Shuttle, NASA did plan to do many and frequent launches, so the Orbiter and the Solid Rocket Boosters were designed to be reusable. It wasn't deemed worthwhile to make the External Tank reusable. Although the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) were reusable and going to be used on the SLS rocket, NASA doesn't plan to reuse them. The refurbishing and recertification costs make reuse more expensive than manufacturing new engines. The French and the Russians did, at one time, work together in an attempt to make the Ariane 5 reusable, but the hardware that would be needed to support the return of the vehicle became too large to make the effort worthwhile. Making a launch vehicle reusable is very difficult.	-0.0044565885327756

The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly. For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior. It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart. Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe. A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea. As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae. “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.	-0.007354802917689

April Flowers for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world’s largest coral reef, and the only living thing on Earth that is visible from space. The Great Barrier Reef is approximately 3000 kilometers long and up to 65 kilometers wide in some places. According to new research from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS ), the Great Barrier Reef has lost half of its coral cover in the last 27 years. The research team attributes this loss to storm damage (48%), crown of thorns starfish (42%), and bleaching (10%). “We can’t stop the storms but, perhaps we can stop the starfish. If we can, then the Reef will have more opportunity to adapt to the challenges of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification,” said John Gunn, CEO of Aims. According to Dr. Peter Doherty, one of the program’s creators, this is the most comprehensive reef-monitoring program in the world. AIMS started broad scale surveillance of more than 100 reefs in 1985. By 1993, the program was incorporating more detailed annual surveys of 47 reefs.	-0.0098779667168855

And that’s a big deal — corals are the lynchpin of entire undersea ecosystems. When they go, the damage reverberates widely and ultimately, even people pay the price. But something similar has been happening to corals’ more temperate cousins in many locations: Forests of kelp. These swaying seaweeds, too, anchor communities of diverse types of fish and other living organisms and, in turn, provide great value to humans through their contribution to fisheries. And recently, there has been some very troubling news for kelp. One forest was wiped out off the southwestern coast of Australia by extremely warm temperatures in 2011, an event that scientists called a “rapid climate-driven regime shift.” More recently, there has been massive death of giant kelp around Tasmania as well.	-0.0102023994550108

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence. However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs. So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly? Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time. Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means. In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue. However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	-0.0023187911137938

This what-if question is not some farfetched scenario. The threats to coral and coral reefs — which include climate change, pollution, coastal development, fishing and the creation of jewelry and souvenirs — are very real. In fact, live, growing coral on Caribbean reefs has declined to just 8 percent of the reefs' composition, compared with more than 50 percent in the 1970s [ source: IUCN Facts ]. So what happens if the coral reefs vanish completely? Some experts predict hunger, poverty and political instability as the livelihoods of the peoples of entire countries disappear. Once the coral is dead, the reefs will also die and erode, destroying important marine life spawning and feeding grounds.

But what if an abrupt heatwave destroyed all of the reefs overnight? Coral reefs take up just 1% of the world’s marine environment. So, no big deal, right? Wrong. Just that 1% is enough to sustain a quarter of all marine animals in the ocean. Two million species live in, on, and around the reefs. For them, corals have been providing food and shelter for 50 million years. The day the reefs disappeared, marine biodiversity would suffer huge losses. The ocean bottom would be taken over by forests of seaweed. Maybe it’s time to give jellyfish soup a try, since there would be plenty of them in the ocean. But for many unique species of fish in the ocean, corals are their only safe habitat. A lot of them would be lost for good. Same goes for sea turtles. Since coral are filter feeders, they clean the water. Remaining species, including dolphins, would be left to survive in very murky waters. They might soon disappear as well, since when the corals disappear, there would be very little fish for them to feed on.	-0.0165820494294166

Other countries that rely heavily on reefs, such as Fiji or Papua New Guinea, have relatively small carbon footprints. Still, Pendleton said, they can take other measures — including not overfishing and avoiding pollution — to prevent putting further pressure on already stressed reefs. The researchers acknowledged that more study is needed to better understand both what is happening to coral reefs and how that will affect humans.

662	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from.Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon. Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters. As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings. Grigg counted these rings to estimate age. In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals. 14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2. All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive. Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years. Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated. But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	-0.0214685145765543

The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly. For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior. It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart. Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe. A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea. As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae. “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.	-0.007354802917689

April Flowers for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world’s largest coral reef, and the only living thing on Earth that is visible from space. The Great Barrier Reef is approximately 3000 kilometers long and up to 65 kilometers wide in some places. According to new research from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS ), the Great Barrier Reef has lost half of its coral cover in the last 27 years. The research team attributes this loss to storm damage (48%), crown of thorns starfish (42%), and bleaching (10%). “We can’t stop the storms but, perhaps we can stop the starfish. If we can, then the Reef will have more opportunity to adapt to the challenges of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification,” said John Gunn, CEO of Aims. According to Dr. Peter Doherty, one of the program’s creators, this is the most comprehensive reef-monitoring program in the world. AIMS started broad scale surveillance of more than 100 reefs in 1985. By 1993, the program was incorporating more detailed annual surveys of 47 reefs.	-0.0098779667168855

And that’s a big deal — corals are the lynchpin of entire undersea ecosystems. When they go, the damage reverberates widely and ultimately, even people pay the price. But something similar has been happening to corals’ more temperate cousins in many locations: Forests of kelp. These swaying seaweeds, too, anchor communities of diverse types of fish and other living organisms and, in turn, provide great value to humans through their contribution to fisheries. And recently, there has been some very troubling news for kelp. One forest was wiped out off the southwestern coast of Australia by extremely warm temperatures in 2011, an event that scientists called a “rapid climate-driven regime shift.” More recently, there has been massive death of giant kelp around Tasmania as well.	-0.0102023994550108

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence. However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs. So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly? Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time. Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means. In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs. This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs. Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs. 2 . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers. Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral. 3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup. You don't live near a coral reef? Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef. Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations. 4. Learn more about coral reefs. How many different species live in reefs? What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms. Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology. When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs. 5. Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	-0.0025436684954911

MARCO_msmarco_doc_17_541106127-15	Between 1750 and 2000, surface-ocean pH has decreased by about 0.1, from about 8.2 to about 8.1.Surface-ocean pH has probably not been below 8.1 during the past 2 million years. Projections suggest that surface-ocean pH could decrease by an additional 0.3–0.4 units by 2100. Ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society. Effects of acidification The effects of ocean acidification can already be seen and have been happening since the start of the industrial revolution, with pH levels of the ocean dropping by 0.1 since the pre-industrial revolution times. An effect called coral bleaching can be seen on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where ocean acidification's effects are already taking place. Coral bleaching is when unicellular organisms that help make up the coral begin to die off and leave the coral giving it a white appearance. These unicellular organisms are important for the coral to feed and get the proper nutrition that is necessary to survive, leaving the coral weak and malnourished. This results in weaker coral that can die more easily and offer less protection to the organisms that depend on coral for shelter and protection.	-0.0567339248955249

MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_919842847-4	Some frame bags use a roll-top design to solve this problem.Seat pack- These teardrop-shaped bags attache to the seat post and saddle rails with straps and velcro. Seat packs usually hold 8-17 liters of gear. These often act as a compression sack. They are great for storing your sleeping bag and clothes. Many models have attachment points on the outside where you can strap additional gear like a cook pot or sandals. In addition to the three primary bags, a number of smaller accessory bags are also available which can add some extra capacity. Some bikepackers attach a 5-8 liter drybag to each side of the forks. Some riders mount gas tank style bags to the top tube for an extra liter or two of storage space. Feed bags mounted to the handlebars are also a good way to store food or extra water bottles. What Are Racks and Panniers? Panniers are large rectangular bags that attach to metal racks on the front and rear of the bike. The racks bolt directly to the frame. Panniers secure to the racks with a plastic or metal hook system. The system varies by brand.

Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms. What are racks and panniers? Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike. They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips. A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad. Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).	-0.0034560970962047

Generally speaking, bikepacking bags are made for off-road use while panniers and racks are made for road riding. Racks and panniers are generally preferred by bicycle tourists who need to carry all of the necessities for weeks, months, or even years on the road. Most bicycle tourists spend more time riding on the pavement and travel long distances. Often internationally. Bikepacking bags are often preferred by those who spend more time riding off-pavement, on long stretches of gravel roads, and single track through rural or wilderness regions. Most bikepackers take a minimalist approach to packing to keep the bike lightweight and agile. What are Bikepacking Bags? Bikepacking bags are soft bags that attach directly to the frame of the bike with straps and Velcro. No metal racks are needed. A wide range of bikepacking bags have hit the market to fit different sizes and styles of bikes. You can find bikepacking bags that will fit pretty much every frame. Many manufacturers are happy to build custom bags for you as well.	-0.0040495544672012

MARCO_msmarco_doc_24_1262185831-24	This pannier system is ideal for larger adventure motorcycles like the KTM1190R or the Honda Africa Twin, but can even fit onto smaller Dual Sport motorcycles like the Suzuki DR650 or even KTM 500EXC enduro.It is constructed from durable heavy-duty nylon, polyester, and includes TPU materials to make it able to withstand the toughest adventure ride. It must be used with a top rack for a secure fitting but does not require any side pannier racks. Five heavy-duty nylon webbing straps allow for quick and easy removal of the entire bag system from the motorcycle. All the straps are replaceable in the event they get damaged. The two 25L side bags have a roll-top closure which is great for keeping water and dust out. Inside each side bag is a 25L 100% waterproof inner dry liner which is also a roll-top closure. What’s great about these is that when you reach your destination, you can simply remove the dry bags with everything inside, and take them with you to the campsite or motel, without having to remove the whole system. It’s easy to add to and customize the setup for your own particular needs and has enough storage capacity for multiple-day rides.	-0.0018358058296144
688	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_31_919842847-20	Weight per liter of storage can be lower with panniers if you use large volume bags and lightweight racks.More on this later. Panniers can’t be mounted to every bike Panniers require a rack to be mounted on. Racks require braze-ons or rack mounts on the frame attach the rack to. Not all bikes come equipped with the proper braze-ons for mounting racks. For example, you shouldn’t mount racks to carbon fiber framed bikes because the weight of the panniers can cause damage to the frame. Often times it is impossible to mount frames to full suspension mountain bikes due to the design. Bikepacking bags can mount to any bike. Your bike components won’t last as long when you use panniers Because you are carrying around more weight, you are putting more wear and tear on your bike and components. Wheels, chains, cassettes, tires, and brake pads all have to work harder when you are carrying around more weight. These items wear out faster and need to be replaced more often. This costs money. Maintenance will also be required more frequently. You must distribute the weight of your gear evenly on your bike while packing panniers If all of your heavy gear is packed on one side, the bike will not be balanced and handling will suffer.	-0.0020085654687136

Do pannier racks fit all bikes? No, unfortunately not all bikes can have standard pannier racks on them, with most road bikes not being able to hold a standard pannier rack. That said, you can still buy a special seat-post-mounted rear rack that functions in a similar way to attach to your road bike. Although this will work for most bike commuters on road bikes, you should be careful not to overload a seat-post-mounted pannier rack since road bikes are designed for speed and are not meant to be weighted down. It is true that their frames can handle a fair amount of weight, but having this strain on your seat post, combined with it affecting the geometry of your road bike, could make it a little difficult to control your road bike if commuting with weighty pannier bags on the back.	-0.0020782793872058

We hope now you know how to make a bike seat more comfortable. Keep your bike saddle in the right position, tipped backwards and take the entire seat when sitting. Don’t sit on the nose of the seat because you won’t feel comfortable there. There will be excessive pressure on some of your delicate arteries in the lower section. And it will cause pain and soreness. When your bike seat is comfortable, you will feel comfortable, and you can ride for long hours. Using thinner padding and padding apparel is another way to make your bike riding more comfortable. Making a specifically designed bike cushion can also solve the problem for you.

WAPO_KH5ECWN25FAZ7IUZ5EBGBCMDGY-1	Like every movie, each tells two stories — one that’s contained in the script, and one that’s unspoken but just as present. The MCU movies are, on the whole, super fun and entertaining. But underneath the stories of bravery and bad guys, they also have implications relating to, among other things, race and gender. Now come the cries of “Ugggggh, of COURSE Kristen has to mention race and gender the last time I have to read her stupid column.” And it’s true — those topics have been recurring here. That’s not only because they interest me, but because they’re topics present in nearly every film. We just don’t usually pay attention to them because films so often reflect society’s norms. All six of the original cinematic Avengers are white, and all but one are male. That’s a reflection of the comic book canon, yes, but the comic book canon reflects common biases: Superheroes who are white and male are the norm.	-0.0049523073248565

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future. This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task. While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward. Time travel is not the easiest thing to bring to the table, and there were plenty of people that poked some holes in the scenario that was brought up in Avengers: Endgame.

Civic Duty The first is what you might have expected, given the end of the movie itself. T'Challa presents Wakanda's anti-isolationist shift to a United Nations-style government body, announcing that his nation will now be open to sharing their resources with the world. Of course, remembering that as far as the rest of the world is concerned in the MCU, Wakanda is a third world, underdeveloped country, he's met with some confusion--all while his new friend CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) smiles knowingly from the back of the crowd. The stinger doesn't overstay its welcome. T'Challa isn't actually shown dropping the proverbial Vibranium bombshell on the poor unsuspecting world leaders, but the implication is enough. The landscape of the MCU, both politically and technologically, is about to change in a major way. This is a deceptively important detail, especially given the MCU's upcoming movie slate. With Wakandan tech made more accessible, the landscape for both superheroes and civilians is about to take a major leap forward--and it's a safe bet that not every change will be positive, especially with the possibility of villains appropriating new tech too.	-0.0092013832181692

But more interestingly, it showed that an actor could so overshadow the hero he portrays that he supplants that character, and it be a good. Before Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, Iron Man was a great suit of armor with a pretty boring alter ego. Stark’s personal story arcs involved heart trouble, alcohol abuse and intellectual property disputes. Downey Jr. brought the quips and the irreverence, and made Tony Stark on film much more fascinating than he had ever been in the comics. And comic book fan and neophyte alike loved the result. On a more basic level, the casting of Downey Jr. represented what would be a triumphant trio of casting moves—Downey Jr., Evans’ Captain America, and Hemsworth’s Thor—that would set the tone for the entire MCU.	-0.0606193467974662

717	147_1-13	That’s a great point. What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2241649836-109	DC has not been able to make their movies different enough from one another.They take the same approach to Wonder Woman that they took to Batman which is a creative choice that baffles me. It’s like their producers chose the wrong aspects of the Chris Nolan Batman movies to recreate and it hasn’t served them well. People liked his Batman trilogy because they were really solid, great films; not because of the dark color palette or moody atmosphere. Marvel on the other hand has actual diversity in their films. They have made straight up action/superheroic blockbusters, they’ve done sci-fi, they’ve done gory horror, light-hearted family films, romance, comedies, heist movies, childrens/young adult movies and I only see them doing more in terms of genre films. Marvel has this thing called variety, something the DCEU sorely needs. Then consider that DC only has seven movies to Marvel’s 16, and of those 16 almost every single one was enjoyable (in my opinion). This is just the core line of MCU films. If you count earlier efforts like Blade, the three Punisher films and Howard the Duck, that number jumps to well over 49 movies! They have another half dozen on the way with countless more to be announced in the future.	-0.0030398610979318

Whether changes involve the biracial Ultimate Spider-Man, a half Latino Nova, the Muslim Ms. Marvel or the all-female X-Men team, Axel Alonso meant it when he assumed the editorship several years ago and said the pages of Marvel Comics would reflect the real world — that no matter who you are, no matter where you’re from or what your religion or sexuality is, everyone deserves to feel like they can be a superhero. 3. Trusting the talent Trust is due to the person crafting this story. Thor: God of Thunder writer Jason Aaron has been penning a pretty spectacular run on this title.

We’re telling the best stories we can,” Alonso said. “We’ve got an unlimited special-effects budget. We have tons of latitude creatively to bend, break and have fun and get people talking at the comic-book stores and beyond. We don’t feel that pressure [to match the movies]. We’re just having fun telling great stories.” Part of the new Marvel comic-book universe is a world that strives for diversity, including a black Captain America, a female Thor and a Hulk who is Asian. That, however, hasn’t come without controversy. Marvel has been criticized in media and social media for the lack of creative diversity behind its recent popular hip hop covers.

720	147_1-15	Could you expand on Justin Gilbert Alba’s comments that the push from fans for diversity in creators and characters only represents a loud minority?	WAPO_ZO3COGYHZVGOBAHV7PCWGZ22ME-7	This trend in the MCU takes on new urgency in the context of Feige’s new job as chief creative officer at Marvel Comics, a corporate shake-up ostensibly designed to replicate his silver-screen magic on the comic book page. And this means that those corporate politics may end up infecting the source material that remains the beating heart of the entire creative enterprise. Indeed, the look and feel of the titular team in “The Avengers,” down to Samuel L. Jackson’s role as Nick Fury, was directly inspired and shaped by 2002’s comic book miniseries “The Ultimates.” In virtually every other detail throughout the rest of the franchise, from the broad details of stories to the particulars of dialogue, the entire venture rests on those and other comics. He who controls the comics controls the fate of the entire Marvel enterprise. Disney investors and analysts expect the launch of Disney+ to prove a success, and it’s certainly possible that it will bolster Marvel’s creative venture more than any best-selling comics saga ever could.	-0.0082619087770581

WAPO_JHEYLEY2SNFNFJHUMB5N5UCXDI-6	These questions were often lost or muddied in the course of corporate tampering. While Marvel honcho Kevin Feige has hired a series of directors who will conform to the house style and has built up a universe slowly but surely, Snyder always seemed to be pushing for more and was saddled with a corporate giant that demanded an Avenger-style cinematic universe created in half the time. As Armond White put it in his review of “Black Panther,” “Coogler’s attempt at genre revision is part of Marvel indoctrination, so it’s less interesting than Snyder’s battle with Warner Bros. over artistic expression in the D.C. Comics Universe. Snyder turns moral conflicts into sensual kinetics.” * Perhaps “Justice League,” which asks how the world would respond to losing its newfound god, is a logical endpoint to the question first raised in “Man of Steel.” It’s too bad that we’ll likely never get to see what Snyder truly wanted to do with the movie; he was reportedly fired last year and was definitely replaced in the director’s chair by Joss Whedon for reshoots.	-0.0148410312831401

Plus, a Marvel female superhero won’t get a solo film till early 2019 (“Captain Marvel,” with Brie Larson as the titular character), nearly two years after DC scored big with “Wonder Woman” — yet it’s part of the same overdue move toward larger diversity at the studio. Much credit for the course correction must go to Marvel Studios president, Kevin Feige, who fought his corporate creative battles especially strategically once 2008’s “Iron Man” effectively launched Marvel’s current universe.	-0.0196992885321378

In which Disney ( MARVEL) has performed extra-ordinary work by setting up their MCU so well that not a single movie seems apart from their MCU. Solo movie such as Iron Man 3, Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok are the best work by MARVEL cinematic workspace. These movies are much filled with passion then WB 's ( DC) movies.

Originally Answered: SPOILER SPOILER! … In Endgame, how was Thanos able to put up such a fight against the Avengers trio (CA, Thor, IM) without any stones, while in Infinity War, IM alone gave him a hard fight? Well Thanos by himself is a shrewd fighter. If iron man had faced him when he just had the power stone like Thor did he would have had the same fate. The psyche of Thor and Thanos during the fight played a huge part in its outcome. Infinity war Thanos: Thanos is deeply saddened by the loss of Gamora.	-0.038717120885849

WAPO_KH5ECWN25FAZ7IUZ5EBGBCMDGY-1	Like every movie, each tells two stories — one that’s contained in the script, and one that’s unspoken but just as present. The MCU movies are, on the whole, super fun and entertaining. But underneath the stories of bravery and bad guys, they also have implications relating to, among other things, race and gender. Now come the cries of “Ugggggh, of COURSE Kristen has to mention race and gender the last time I have to read her stupid column.” And it’s true — those topics have been recurring here. That’s not only because they interest me, but because they’re topics present in nearly every film. We just don’t usually pay attention to them because films so often reflect society’s norms. All six of the original cinematic Avengers are white, and all but one are male. That’s a reflection of the comic book canon, yes, but the comic book canon reflects common biases: Superheroes who are white and male are the norm.	-0.0049523073248565

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future. This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task. While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward. Time travel is not the easiest thing to bring to the table, and there were plenty of people that poked some holes in the scenario that was brought up in Avengers: Endgame. Nevertheless bringing in Kang the Conqueror means that everything is on the table in regard to mixing things up on the timeline.

Civic Duty The first is what you might have expected, given the end of the movie itself. T'Challa presents Wakanda's anti-isolationist shift to a United Nations-style government body, announcing that his nation will now be open to sharing their resources with the world. Of course, remembering that as far as the rest of the world is concerned in the MCU, Wakanda is a third world, underdeveloped country, he's met with some confusion--all while his new friend CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) smiles knowingly from the back of the crowd. The stinger doesn't overstay its welcome. T'Challa isn't actually shown dropping the proverbial Vibranium bombshell on the poor unsuspecting world leaders, but the implication is enough. The landscape of the MCU, both politically and technologically, is about to change in a major way. This is a deceptively important detail, especially given the MCU's upcoming movie slate. With Wakandan tech made more accessible, the landscape for both superheroes and civilians is about to take a major leap forward--and it's a safe bet that not every change will be positive, especially with the possibility of villains appropriating new tech too.	-0.0092013832181692

But more interestingly, it showed that an actor could so overshadow the hero he portrays that he supplants that character, and it be a good. Before Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, Iron Man was a great suit of armor with a pretty boring alter ego. Stark’s personal story arcs involved heart trouble, alcohol abuse and intellectual property disputes. Downey Jr. brought the quips and the irreverence, and made Tony Stark on film much more fascinating than he had ever been in the comics. And comic book fan and neophyte alike loved the result. On a more basic level, the casting of Downey Jr. represented what would be a triumphant trio of casting moves—Downey Jr., Evans’ Captain America, and Hemsworth’s Thor—that would set the tone for the entire MCU.	-0.0606193467974662

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2241649836-109	DC has not been able to make their movies different enough from one another.They take the same approach to Wonder Woman that they took to Batman which is a creative choice that baffles me. It’s like their producers chose the wrong aspects of the Chris Nolan Batman movies to recreate and it hasn’t served them well. People liked his Batman trilogy because they were really solid, great films; not because of the dark color palette or moody atmosphere. Marvel on the other hand has actual diversity in their films. They have made straight up action/superheroic blockbusters, they’ve done sci-fi, they’ve done gory horror, light-hearted family films, romance, comedies, heist movies, childrens/young adult movies and I only see them doing more in terms of genre films. Marvel has this thing called variety, something the DCEU sorely needs. Then consider that DC only has seven movies to Marvel’s 16, and of those 16 almost every single one was enjoyable (in my opinion). This is just the core line of MCU films. If you count earlier efforts like Blade, the three Punisher films and Howard the Duck, that number jumps to well over 49 movies! They have another half dozen on the way with countless more to be announced in the future.	-0.0030398610979318

Trusting the talent Trust is due to the person crafting this story. Thor: God of Thunder writer Jason Aaron has been penning a pretty spectacular run on this title.

We’re telling the best stories we can,” Alonso said. “We’ve got an unlimited special-effects budget. We have tons of latitude creatively to bend, break and have fun and get people talking at the comic-book stores and beyond. We don’t feel that pressure [to match the movies]. We’re just having fun telling great stories.” Part of the new Marvel comic-book universe is a world that strives for diversity, including a black Captain America, a female Thor and a Hulk who is Asian. That, however, hasn’t come without controversy. Marvel has been criticized in media and social media for the lack of creative diversity behind its recent popular hip hop covers.

(Marvel’s television slate, which includes four series in development for Netflix, has been more representative.)

WAPO_NHSQOFLA7JB5LAS5LWDWOBWILU-0	This column discusses the plot of “Captain Marvel” in general terms.  “Captain Marvel” is the “Lean In” of superhero movies, an anodyne girl-power story that treats one woman’s journey of self-discovery as a proxy for galaxy-level change. Though the film is precisely engineered to appeal to critics like me — feminist women who came of age in the 1990s — it’s a disappointment, from the poorly shot action sequences to a shallowly written hero’s journey. More than anything else, “Captain Marvel” is the perfect caution that giving women and people of color top billing in major franchise movies is no guarantee that those films will say anything interesting, much less daring. In fact, the very scale at which these franchises need to appeal to audiences and the nature of their corporate entanglements suggests that these sorts of movies may be a trap for people who are eager to see not merely new faces, but new ideas of heroism, on-screen.	-0.0106341838836669

That was big one.” The upcoming Marvel film is a big deal for a lot of people, as it continues Black Panther's tradition of being one of the pioneering people of color to ever headline his own comic book run, and now his own film. Not only do the Black Panther trailers suggest the film is visually stunning, its cast is full of brilliant actors of color, further ensuring that Wakanda will come off as being a believable South African country, despite being a fictional one. Plus, with Coogler at the helm, it is safe to assume that the film will be a more accurate representation of African culture - something that a lot of movies and TV shows have botched over the years. As for the reveal that there will be a conversation between T'Challa and his late father, T'Chaka, it will be interesting to see where this particular sequence factors in the movie. It could be a flashback or it could also be in a vision, as Black Panther looks to delve into mysticism, as much as it will tackle science and technology.	-0.0213697999715805

Now, I call sexism out when I see it, and I don’t see it here. The truth is that, in the case of this movie, advertising can only do so much. “Wonder Woman” is the first movie in recent history that is both a superhero movie and a movie with a female lead.

Even in the Golden Age she was still objectified and her nonviolence used as a stand-in for female sexual submission. Ultimately, we’ve never actually seen a Wonder Woman who’s been empowered enough to radically commit to ideals of peace and love, without being sexualized, objectified, briefly (or totally) compromised, or undermined by her own narrative in the process. We don’t know what that hero would look like on screen, because we’ve never actually seen her off screen either.

She continues: Advertisement She’s the missing link in a chain of events that begins with the woman suffrage campaigns of the 1910s and ends with the troubled place of feminism fully a century later. Feminism made Wonder Woman. This argument represents the meat of the book, and the case Lepore lays out to support it is ironclad. A lot like Marston’s Wonder Woman, if you follow me. But she goes on: “And then Wonder Woman remade feminism, which hasn’t always been good for feminism.” This is just a fascinating statement, but the argument she makes for it gets largely shunted to the book’s epilogue, which covers the late ’60s onward.	-0.0117559507489204

MARCO_msmarco_doc_51_58815921-2	Grow Your Tech Network Every recruiter needs a good business network to pull candidates from, but as you begin to narrow your focus to specific industries, your network needs to get more focused as well.In order to find more technical candidates, get referrals from existing contacts in technical industries. Ask them what conferences they are attending, then maybe attend a few yourself. Visit local colleges that train in technical fields to find fresh talent, and look for trade organizations for technical professionals. Take all the advice for growing your network and apply it to technical industries. Research Your Industries Because technical positions can be, well, technical, itâ€™s important for a technical recruiter to have a thorough knowledge of the various positions they will be sourcing candidates for. While some of this knowledge can be gained through experience, recruiters that are looking to focus in technology recruiting should learn as much as they can about the pay structures, job titles and common management structures used in these industries as quickly as possible. To find out about these sort of things, recruiters can talk to their technical candidates as well as their clients. Find Talent on the Web Many technical candidates network with each other using the Internet, so a recruiter who wants to source technical talent needs to go where the candidates are.	-0.0045239957980811

By asking questions and understanding the trends in your industry, community and state, you’re setting yourself up for success. 3. Be proactive. Share your voice and opinions Want to shape the future of your industry? Then let your voice be heard. People who are active in their networks can have a big impact on the conversations that inform that space. The takeaway is that if you have something worth contributing, take ownership of it and the whole community will benefit.

It will serve you far better to talk about who you read and how you stay current on the latest happenings in cyber security than to gratuitously name-drop (so avoid claiming that you’re poker buddies with Eugene Kaspersky). According to Forbes, the key to starting a lucrative career in cyber security is to “get involved in meetups, attend conferences, ask for tips over coffee with current security professionals of local tech companies. If these things aren’t possible, online networking is a good idea too.” There are dozens of cyber security groups on LinkedIn, with topics ranging from general to highly specific. 7. Don’t feel like you have to be an expert on everything The world of cyber security continues to evolve rapidly, meaning there will invariably be new technology, trends or threats with which you are not intimately familiar. Rather than present yourself as an expert generalist with across-the-board knowledge, highlight your own skills and experiences that best connect to what you see as the needs of the organization.	-0.0059891049750149

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2403873835-35	I think this mostly speaks to the terrible state of wages in the United States.Now, as to why: you're mostly correct that it's due to supply and demand. There are a lot of software engineers, but only some of them are good enough to work at a big firm like Google. But also, there's a huge amount of money in software that there isn't in other industries. Not only is it still new, but there's a ton of money going into the industry. Google makes a ton of money. VCs who got rich doing other things are pouring money randomly into assorted startups. Another big factor is that you don't need that much manpower to operate a tech company, so you can afford to increase your salaries to attract better talent. And finally, the culture: people who are running tech companies probably used to be engineers themselves, and thus are more sympathetic to software engineers' salary. Honestly, I feel like the amount of students going into software isn't going to increase. I get the feeling we're actually coming down from the peak of available software engineers at the peak of the dot com bubble. Stan Tan , works at OwlGuru.com	-0.0335589721798896

If you want to make more money If you want to work in tech and make the most money possible, you should be applying to tech giants (think Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google). Simply put, they offer the highest compensation in the industry. However, for many people, working at a startup will always be preferable to working at a giant corporation. Some people prefer the high risk, high reward potential of owning equity in a startup. Others simply can't work in a non-startup environment. If you'd rather take a chance at being an early employee at the next Google than being employee 85,000 at a tech giant, or if you just love startups but want to maximize your income, you need to do three things: Figure out how much pure cash you can make. This is obvious, but you want to establish that you'll be making the most cash possible via your salary and bonuses.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_1503049432-11	So what you should be doing after you get home from an interview is: Deciding if you are interested in the position so can respond appropriately when they give feedback Tracking the dates of your past interviews so you know when to follow-up if you’ve heard no response Applying for more jobs!Never count on one single opportunity to work out, and keep applying for positions until you’ve accepted a job offer… You could do everything right in the interview and still not get the job. There’s a lot of luck involved in job searching. So counting on one single job offer is dangerous and could set you back weeks if it turns out you get rejected after the interview. So even though it’s tempting to wait and hope for good news, keep applying for positions and setting up interviews. What To Do Next: No matter how you think your interview went, the best thing you can do is keep job searching. Keep applying for jobs. Keep your momentum going. The biggest mistake I see job seekers make is they get 1 or 2 interviews and stop applying for jobs, and they just hope those first couple of interviews will turn into job offers. Don’t gamble. Keep applying.	-0.0026638756971806

MARCO_msmarco_doc_13_836362029-9	If you find yourself getting really nervous, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom to get some air.Don’t take too long but it is better to collect your thoughts than to plow ahead when you can’t focus. Fidget. This might be something you have to practice but it is worth it. Get defensive. The interviewer will be asking technical questions. Everyone has their weak spots and that is okay – work with it and practice for it. Bring coffee. What to do after an interview First of all, take a deep breath, you’ve gotten through the most stressful part. While waiting for a response from the hiring manager can definitely be frustrating, knowing what to do after an interview can actually help you influence the outcome. Once you’ve accomplished these steps, you can rest assured that you did everything in your power to get the job offer. 1. Drop off your thank you note. Always, always thank your interviewer after you’ve left. Email them after you drop off your note. The more contact you have, the more you remain in their minds over the other applicants. It shows you’re thoughtful, motivated, and that you care.	-0.004407453816384

Be positive and engaging Now is not the time to speak negatively about your former employer. Instead, remain positive about your experiences and provide engaging dialogue. What to do after your interview As your interview comes to an end, don’t forget these last steps! Before the call ends, you will likely be extended the opportunity to ask questions. This is where you will ask the questions that you prepared in advance. After you’ve done so, thank the interviewer for their time and, of course, confirm what the next steps will be. Once you hang up, pause for a few seconds to ensure that you have fully left the call and that your microphone and camera are off. The final step in your interview process is to send a follow-up email to say thank you. The purpose is to further communicate your interest in the position and set yourself apart from other candidates. You can view these examples of thank you notes to jog your creativity.	-0.0051443353295326

The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking)."	-0.0177842993289232

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant. But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble."" This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you. Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether. We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience. 1. Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode. In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account. This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results. To switch to private mode, click the menu button in the top-right corner of your browser and choose New incognito window (in Chrome), New Private Window (in Firefox), or New InPrivate window (in Edge)."	-0.0052347024902701

KILT_25606638-0	Search neutralitySearch neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance. This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider's domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias.Search neutrality is related to network neutrality in that they both aim to keep any one organization from limiting or altering a user's access to services on the Internet. Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.	-0.014233261346817

Is Your Search Engine Biased? October 16, 2018 April 4, 2019 by Search Encrypt Search neutrality is the idea that a search engine does not limit or influence a person’s ability to access information on the internet. The search engine market is very one sided with just a couple companies controlling the entire market. “ Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.

KILT_25606638-2	"There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as ""search neutrality"" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as ""what is search neutrality?"" or ""what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?"", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality. Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking)."	-0.0177842993289232

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant. But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble."" This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you. Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether. We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience. 1. Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode. In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account. This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results.

MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines).There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative. Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer. A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself. (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.) Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms. I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all. The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	-0.0022251864429563

Now there is one thing that can’t be quantified, but it could make Google results biased in some cases. And that’s the fact that Google’s algorithm is designed and operated by humans. Humans are inherently biased in one way or another. You must also consider that Google uses over 10,000 humans for manually reviewing the quality of their search engine results.

Europe Most countries' markets in the European Union are dominated by Google, except for the Czech Republic, where Seznam is a strong competitor. Search engine bias Although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy, empirical studies indicate various political, economic, and social biases in the information they provide and the underlying assumptions about the technology. These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes (e.g., companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results), and political processes (e.g., the removal of search results to comply with local laws). For example, Google will not surface certain neo-Nazi websites in France and Germany, where Holocaust denial is illegal.

How Suggestions Are Ranked How are the suggestions shown ranked? Are the more popular searches listed above others? No . Popularity is a factor, but some less popular searches might be shown above more popular ones, if Google deems them more relevant, the company says. Personalized searches will always come before others. Deduplicating & Spelling Corrections There a small degree of deduplicating and spelling correction that happens in the final suggestions that show, Google says.

827	149_2-3	But how are search engines racist?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_56_1304807776-5	According to the Google insider, once it is labeled, Google’s algorithms kick in to determine where that information should appear in search results.Conservative sources are often labeled “Right Wing” by this AI process, and then pushed down in search results. The unnamed source also says that Google is pushing its political agenda through the use of its platform. Trump doesn’t line up with that agenda, and it is believed Google intends to stifle truth during the 2020 elections. How It Works If Google is manipulating search results by determining what you see in the automated search suggestions, then it will be fairly easy to find out. When you begin typing in a search term, auto fill results begin popping up in a list below where you are typing. These have typically been placed because they are the top search terms that contain the keywords you are looking for. This means that all users should get the same results. However, Google has allegedly changed that algorithm by boosting searches that line up with their political agenda, and hiding those which don’t. For instance, if we type “Hillary Clinton’s emails ” in the search bar, we get zero suggestions.	-0.0201232526451349
828	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_msmarco_doc_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly.The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found. These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color. For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests. One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence. Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms. But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology. Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people. Take cannabis arrests, for just one example. Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	-0.003307944862172
829	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_msmarco_doc_24_411144558-5	The reasoning behind this is three-fold.(1) Data collected for facial recognition databases can come from drivers licenses, passport photos and IDs, but is most commonly from mugshots (not necessarily of charged criminals, but of anyone arrested). And, because of systematic anti-Black and racist bias in the police department, Black people are more likely to be arrested and thus, to have mugshots taken. (2) Additionally, people are almost never deleted from the database even if the charges against them were dropped, so this means that facial recognition databases are more likely to include a majority Black/darker-skinned people. (3) Finally, facial recognition algorithms are rarely tested for accuracy and bias and it has been shown that facial recognition software is often biased against dark-skinned/Black folks, most significantly not being able to tell them apart, especially because these facial recognition algorithms only say whether a person is more or less likely a match, not a direct yes or no.

830	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	WAPO_DK4R6ILW2FHFXAZ2ZTBAQQWO6A-2	The algorithms — formulas for processing information or completing tasks — that make these judgments are programmed by people and thus often reproduce human biases, unintentionally or otherwise, resulting in less favorable outcomes for women and people of color. But the public, and even companies themselves, often have little visibility into how algorithms operate. “Women tend to be better credit risks. While it is illegal to discriminate the data indicates that controlling for income, and other things, women are better credit risks,” said Aaron Klein, a Brookings Institution fellow. “So giving men better terms of credit is both illegal and seems to be inconsistent with international experience.” Past iterations of Google Translate have struggled with gender bias in translations. Amazon was forced to jettison an experimental recruiting tool in 2017 that used artificial intelligence to score candidates because the prevalence of male candidates resulted in the algorithm penalizing résumés that included “women’s” and downgrading candidates who attended women’s colleges.	-0.0041274367831647

834	149_1-1	Are search engines biased?	MARCO_msmarco_doc_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines).There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative. Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer. A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself. (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.) Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms. I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all. The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	-0.0022251864429563

We Analyzed 50 Key Politically-Driven Topics to Find Out June 13, 2020 June 12, 2020 by Nathan Gotch Is Google biased against conservatives? The short answer is not likely. Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google’s search results were non-partisan. While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites. Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased. But here’s the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google’s algorithm is biased. Let’s dive into the case study. Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist? 63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective. 316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites. Websites that present facts. Not opinions. This is super important for politically-driven topics where there tends to be lots of misinformation or “ fake news ”.	-0.0024906350299715

MARCO_msmarco_doc_41_1834051265-6	It’s not perfect and the results lean left, but it’s likely not because Google’s algorithms are biased.It’s because those left-leaning websites are simply better at SEO. Now there is one thing that can’t be quantified, but it could make Google results biased in some cases. And that’s the fact that Google’s algorithm is designed and operated by humans. Humans are inherently biased in one way or another. You must also consider that Google uses over 10,000 humans for manually reviewing the quality of their search engine results. It’s entirely possible that these humans could suppress pages they don’t agree with. Bias is inevitable when humans are involved. If you’d like to see all the data we used for this case study go here (no opt-in required). How to We Conducted the Google Bias Project The way we conducted this case study was simple: 1. We found over 300 “controversial” topics using sites like ProCon.org 2. We broke that list down and focused on 50 politically-driven topics (see them here ). Why? Because political bias is easier to identify. 3. We scraped Google’s SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages) for each topic using the Data Miner plugin for Chrome 4.	-0.003810646245256

Ranking A good ranking ensures that from the billions of pages indexed you receive the most relevant results regarding to your query. A search engine could bias the search results either by completely filtering the search results from specific sites or by giving it a lower ranking, for all or for specific queries, and thus burying as rarely somebody looks beyond the first two or three results pages. Auto complete / suggestion / query rewriting Search engines assist the user in completing and refining their search queries, which ultimately influences the search results which are returned to the user. A search engine could bias the search results by blocking certain suggestions or by proposing different suggestions.

Taiwan are the most popular avenues for Internet searches in Japan and Taiwan, respectively. China is one of few countries where Google is not in the top three web search engines for market share. Google was previously a top search engine in China, but had to withdraw after failing to follow China's laws. Europe Most countries' markets in the European Union are dominated by Google, except for the Czech Republic, where Seznam is a strong competitor. Search engine bias Although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy, empirical studies indicate various political, economic, and social biases in the information they provide and the underlying assumptions about the technology. These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes (e.g., companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results), and political processes (e.g., the removal of search results to comply with local laws). For example, Google will not surface certain neo-Nazi websites in France and Germany, where Holocaust denial is illegal. Biases can also be a result of social processes, as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non-normative viewpoints in favor of more ""popular"" results."	-0.0046367272734642

At the time, business was ""overwhelmingly pro-European"", and Harold Wilson met several prominent industrialists to elicit support. It was common for pro-Europeans to convene across party and ideological lines with businessmen. John Mills, the national agent of the ""No"" campaign, recalled: ""We were operating on a shoe-string compared to the Rolls Royce operation on the other side"". However, it was also the case that many civil society groups supported the ""Yes"" campaign, including the National Farmers Union and some trade unions.Much of the ""Yes"" campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents.

WAPO_QWZNLOQ7XVF33FYFU5UKXKNQ34-2	Yes, Chinese leaders seek to change existing international institutions, but their ambitions to date far outpace their achievements. Yes, there is an ideological dimension to U.S.-Chinese competition: Chinese leaders champion their model of autocratic, state-led development as an alternative to liberal democracy. But unlike the Soviets, the Chinese Communist Party is not exporting or imposing communism, and it has mostly deployed peaceful means to propagate ideas abroad. The United States and the Soviet Union fought proxy wars all over the world in which millions of people died. Thankfully, that feature of the Cold War has no parallel today. There nonetheless remains an ideological component to U.S.-China relations today. And on that front, we are slipping. When a U.S. police officer commits murder, we fail to live  up to our ideals of defending human rights and rule of law, offering our Chinese communist competitors an opening to discredit our system of government.	-0.0070960875600576

""Isn't it pretty to think so."" represents the ideological beliefs of those who were a part of America's lost generation. The context puts the protagonist, Jake, in a position of not being able to have sex. This, in turn, makes his possible relationship with a woman, Brett, impossible to have. This lack of physical consummation results in the conflict invoking the quote. Brett states that they would have had a ""damned good time together"" and Jake replies. The interaction at hand represents the conflict between the ideological views of the lost generation and the harsh truth of reality. Due to the war, many Americans who fought became disenchanted with America as a whole. This resulted in a mass exodus to Europe, where many felt they could live their lives in piece. They also felt that they could escape all the problems of life by running away from them. The ideology is that without the war the world would have been a perfect, ideal place for them."	-0.0087575176730751
