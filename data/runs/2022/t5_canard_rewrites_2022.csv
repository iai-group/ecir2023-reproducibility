9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that. Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage.  And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor.  Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality.  For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires.  Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .”  Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death.  Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks.  As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	-0.0029807919636368
10	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts. Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem.  The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health.  Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	-0.0044525531120598
11	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_54_1716269004-152	Indicators in the final section pointed to the same conclusions—that engagement in health and climate change is increasing, enabling this engagement to be an important driver of policy change globally. Four key messages emerge from the 41 indicators of the Lancet Countdown's 2018 report.  First, present day changes in labour capacity, vector-borne disease, and food security provide early warning of compounded and overwhelming impacts expected if temperature continues to rise.  Trends in climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerabilities show an unacceptably high risk for the current and future health of populations across the world.  Second, slow progress in reducing emissions and building adaptive capacity threatens both human lives and the viability of the national health systems they depend on, with the potential to disrupt core public-health infrastructure and overwhelm health services.  Third, despite these delays, trends in a number of sectors are helping to generate the beginning of a low-carbon transition, and clearly the nature and scale of the response to climate change will be the determining factor in shaping the health of nations for centuries to come.  And fourth, ensuring a widespread understanding of climate change as a central public-health issue will be vital in delivering an accelerated response, with the health profession beginning to rise to this challenge.	-0.0061049885116517

15	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_47_1570533441-15	As part of an international agreement signed at the conference, all 27 member states of the European Union agreed to reduce carbon emission s by 20 percent by 2020 (from 1990 levels). The EU also notified the UN of a “conditional offer to increase this cut to 30 percent, provided that other major emitters agree to take on their fair share of a global reduction effort.”  This conditional offer illustrates the tension that was present at the conference between developed countries’ high carbon emissions and developing countries’ low or rising carbon use.  In fact, many developing nations argued that the Copenhagen Accord was drafted by a small group of powerful countries and unfairly disadvantages poorer countries, many of which are expected to suffer the worst effects of climate change.  The ageing of Europe’s population is also expected to dramatically affect the continent’s social, political, and financial future.  The overall population of Europe is set to drop from roughly 590 million to 542 million by 2050.  The proportion of people older than 65 will grow from 16 percent to 28 percent.  These projected changes will have two major effects: There will be a smaller work force to create a dynamic and industrious economy, and governments and citizens will have to care for more elderly people.  These changes will affect different regions of Europe in different ways.	-0.0371051132678985
16	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_24_1834897315-2	Participating nations agree on a maximum annual emission limit as part of their contribution towards curbing global warming. The Protocol recognizes that countries differ in their ability to tackle climate change due to their varying levels of economic development.  The participating countries are therefore categorized as Annex 1 (developed nations), considered largely responsible for historical emissions, and Non-Annex 1 (developing countries).  Only Annex 1 countries agree on an emissions limit, while Non-Annex 1 countries can earn carbon credits by investing in projects that reduce carbon emissions in their own countries.  These carbon credits can be sold to Annex 1 countries, to allow them to emit more CO2e, thus promoting clean, sustainable development and generating income for the Non-Annex 1 countries.  How Does The Carbon Credit System Affect Businesses and Organizations?  As well as operating at the international level, many countries also operate national or regional carbon credit schemes, such as the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), California’s greenhouse gas scheme or the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the northeastern United States.  This effectively delegates some of the responsibility for a country’s emissions targets to its largest corporate emitters.  These schemes require mandated businesses to obtain a credit for each tonne of CO2e that they emit annually.	-0.076648436486721
17	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_18_3480200950-24	The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history.  Currently climate change is affecting the global community in each country of the world.  Its impact affects not only national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions.  By 2018, climate change continued exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods, affecting more than 39 million of people.  Over the period 2000–2018, green house emissions of developed countries and economies in transitions have declined by 6.5%.  The emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013.  In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.  Plastic polymers are derived from fossil fuels and plastics account for 6% of global oil consumption.  Therefore, plastics and GHG emissions are intricately connected with every step of the plastic life cycle, from production to transportation to waste disposal, contributing to climate change.	-0.259574681520462
18	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).  These investments can help spur an even larger clean energy economy around the world, unleash additional emission reduction efforts, and help countries address the devastating impacts of climate change that will set back the well-being of their citizens.	-0.0030399798415601
19	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_35_526302661-10	Adaptation Developed countries “shall provide adequate, predictable and sustainable” finance, technology and capacity-building to support the implementation of adaptation actions in developing countries. Forestry The accord declares the “immediate establishment of a mechanism…to enable the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries” to support efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and to enhance forest sinks.  Finance “Scaled up, new and additional, predictable and adequate funding” is to be provided to developing countries to support mitigation efforts (including forest-related), adaptation, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building.  For the period 2010-2012, developed countries have a “collective commitment” to provide “new and additional resources…approaching USD 30 billion.”  Developed countries also commit to a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020, “in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.”  The long-term finance is to be a mix of public (bilateral and multilateral) and private resources.  The accord calls for a new Copenhagen Green Climate Fund as one channel for delivering finance and a High Level Panel “to study the contribution of the potential sources of revenue” toward the long-term funding goal.	-0.0030652941204607

MARCO_15_1888001823-3	Adaptation Governments agreed to strengthen societies' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change; provide continued and enhanced international support for adaptation to developing countries. Loss and damage The agreement also recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; acknowledges the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.  Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.  A new and higher goal will be set for after this period.	-0.0032920234370976

MARCO_25_570836921-8	This will make it far easier to draw in the largest pools of capital that need long-term certainty in order to invest in clean technologies. Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	-0.0111026829108595

MARCO_48_1251187189-9	Countries are also expected to revisit their pledges and put forward progressively stronger targets every five years, with the goal of further driving down emissions. Nations must participate in a “ global stocktake ” to measure collective efforts toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals as well.  Meanwhile, developed countries also have to estimate how much financial assistance they’ll allocate to developing nations to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in the frameworks of other international agreements.  While the system doesn’t include financial penalties, the requirements are aimed at making the progress of individual nations easy to track and fostering a sense of global peer pressure, discouraging any dragging of feet among countries that may consider doing so.  Mobilize support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing nations.  Recognizing that many developing countries and small island nations that have contributed the least to climate change could suffer the most from its consequences, the Paris Agreement includes a plan for developed countries—and others “in a position to do so”—to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries mitigate and increase resilience to climate change.	-0.017653364688158

MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).  These investments can help spur an even larger clean energy economy around the world, unleash additional emission reduction efforts, and help countries address the devastating impacts of climate change that will set back the well-being of their citizens.	-0.0199312753975391

The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit.  Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday.  Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.”  Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  He also announced that Britain will ban new gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035, cutting the current target of 2040 by five years.  Other countries, such as Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, are banning fossil fuel vehicles by 2030.  Britain’s car industry questioned whether the goal is achievable."	-0.0274925846606493

The Paris Agreement was an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year, including the United States then under the presidency of Barack Obama.  Due to the status of the United States and China as the greatest emitters of carbon dioxide, Obama's support and his cooperation with China were seen as major factors leading to the convention's early success.	-0.0048966724425554

Steeper reductions would be necessary to meet the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a pledge the United States and most of the world’s other nations first made in 1992 and have reaffirmed frequently, including in the 2015 Paris agreement.  Trump has since said he plans to withdraw from the Paris accord.  Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said in an interview that his group had found that more aggressive action by U.S. officials, such as a nationwide carbon tax of $50 per ton, could cut the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent over the next decade.  “Market forces don’t do that by themselves,” Bordoff said.  “You need regulations.”  But current and former Trump administration officials said the new rule represents a more restrained approach that would allow state regulators rather than Washington bureaucrats to determine the right energy mix for their region.	-0.0214630309492349

In preparing for Paris, more than 150 countries have submitted national climate targets covering nearly 90 per cent of global emissions.  An agreement in Paris will not be the end point, but it can be a decisive turning point in how all countries, acting together under an agreed, transparent legal framework, will set out a pathway to limit global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius – the internationally agreed goal.	-0.0310541372746229

Paris would have prayed to the gods to help him and then would really just rely on their help.  The two different fights that Paris and Hector had fought in, clearly demonstrates how Hector has more courage.  There is another example of how cowardly Paris is in book seven.  It is when Hector goes to the halls of Paris to find him polishing his armor rather than fighting.  He berates his brother and Paris admits that he is a coward and pledges to proceed to battle immediately.  My next comparison is on how Hector and Paris differ on how they display their emotion of love.  Hector loves his wife and son very much, but knows his responsibilities.  Hector shows his responsibility by stepping up to fight in battle, but he shows compassion towards his wife and love for his son.  In book seven before Hector goes off to battle, he goes looking for his wife, only to find her watching over the battle.  Andromache begs Hector to think of his son, Astayanax and not risk his life in the midst of the battle, but to guide the fight from the walls Continue for 3 more pages » • Join now to read essay Paris Vs.	-0.0458048656582832

MARCO_05_1265566543-4	When it becomes hydrated, we can use it to mould things, and if we allow it to dry, it hardens and retains whatever the shape it is set before drying. What is the Difference Between Gypsum and Plaster of Paris?  Gypsum is a naturally occurring soft sulfate mineral whereas plaster of Paris is a building material that we use for protective or decorative coating purposes.  Both these materials contain calcium sulfate as the major constituent.  Although both gypsum and plaster of Paris contain calcium sulfate as the major component, they have differently hydrated calcium sulfate.  Hence the two materials become different from each other.  Therefore, the key difference between gypsum and plaster of Paris is that Gypsum contains calcium sulfate dihydrate whereas plaster of Paris contains calcium sulfate hemihydrates.  Moreover, another difference between gypsum and plaster of Paris is that we can mould plaster of Paris into different shapes when we moisten it while we cannot do this for gypsum.  Summary – Gypsum vs Plaster of Paris The production of plaster of Paris is mainly from gypsum.  However, there are few differences between gypsum and plaster of Paris.  Among them, the key difference between gypsum and plaster of Paris is that the gypsum contains calcium sulfate dihydrate whereas the plaster of Paris contains calcium sulfate hemihydrates.

44	132_2-13	How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?	MARCO_54_276512227-6	And would the rich world be defined strictly as the U.S., the EU, Canada, and Japan? The United States preferred for China and India—two wealthy, powerful nations that also contain hundreds of millions of people still in poverty—to pitch into that $100 billion target.  Yet even as those two Asian nations talked up their own investment in climate-vulnerable nations, they blanched at being compelled to join the rich world’s pledge.  The solution: So here’s something counter-intuitive.  The text commonly called the “Paris Agreement” is actually two different documents: the agreement itself, which is legally binding, and the Paris decision, which passes the agreement and sets out a number of less legally binding ways to approach and observe it.  The Paris agreement includes no new specific commitments to finance.  But item 115 of the Paris decision says that more than that $100 billion will be needed:  *  *  * How often should nations check and reassess their emission reductions?  The problem: Two different mechanisms apply here.  The first is stock-taking, when countries will announce how they’ve reduced carbon emissions.  The draft Paris agreement now says global stock-takes will take place every five years.	-0.066219575703144

MARCO_21_1042238345-1	How to make DIY makeup remover and reusable makeup remover wipes | Hello Homestead How to make DIY makeup remover and reusable makeup remover wipes DIY Lifestyle By Sam Schipani Last updated May 28, 2019 Making reusable makeup remover wipes and DIY makeup remover helps to reduce waste in your beauty routine and also saves money in the long run.  Photo by Sam Schipani Every so often, though, I like to clean up with a fresh face of makeup.  There is one thing I cannot stand about makeup, though: waste, especially when it comes to removing my makeup at the end of the day.  That’s why I decided to make my own reusable makeup remover wipes and DIY makeup remover.  It not only helps me do my part to reduce waste in my beauty routine, but it also saves me money in the long run.  Though the evidence supporting it is largely anecdotal, certain essential oils are considered effective for specific skin problems.  I usually use lavender, because I like the smell and I hear it reduces blemishes.  I also like peppermint because it allegedly helps with blackheads and dermatitis and it is just so darn refreshing.  Frankincense essential oil is supposedly good for aging skin and rosemary is also recommended for oily skin, so maybe I will be trying that one soon.	-0.0148016838356852

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own.  Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients.  Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though!  To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well.  Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture.  Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover.  The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	-0.0172868184745311

54	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor. It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks.  STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48.  Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7.  Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10.  Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22.  Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes.  These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48.  Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection.  Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	-0.0483831353485584
55	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_59_278535003-10	This allows the product to properly soak in overnight. The antiperspirant benefits of these products don’t wash off as quickly as the deodorant components do when you’re showering.  Longevity: The length of time that a deodorant provides effective odor and wetness control might be another important factor to consider.  The longevity of each product will vary significantly based on the individual, activity level, timing of bathing, the weather and more.  Residue: We all know how annoying it is to find white deodorant streaks on our dark clothing.  Some deodorants also leave residue on lighter colored fabrics, and antiperspirants are often blamed for leaving yellowish marks on clothing over time.  Certain common antiperspirants, such as aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY, react with sweat and cause such yellowing.  Cost: Deodorant prices range significantly, from under $5 to over $25.  Because it is a product that you’ll purchase regularly, cost may be a factor when making your decision.  Be sure to look at the net weight of product contained when price shopping; some of the containers are significantly larger than others.  Also, consider product waste when using aerosol sprays.  Although they contain more product than other deodorants by net weight, you lose some to the surrounding air when applying.	-0.0546892136335372

66	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_47_521703086-1	How to Make Scented Body Lotion - ModernMom How to Make Scented Body Lotion October 11, 2016 by ModernMom Staff Leave a Comment Scented body lotion can be expensive and may contain irritants or allergens.  You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.  Essential oils are extracted from plants and can be less potentially irritating or allergenic.	-0.0035657414700835
67	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_47_521703086-2	You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries. Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.  Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container.  Enjoy your new scented body lotion.  Warnings Choose a good quality lotion to avoid problems with separation and spoilage.	-0.0058780666440725

AND you will have complete control over the ingredients.  I set about making a batch of homemade lotion to give as gifts this holiday season with some of my favorite Moutain Rose Herbs ingredients.  Rose-Scented Homemade Lotion Ingredients To make this rose-scented, rich, nourishing, yet lightweight and non-greasy homemade lotion with a pump-able consistency, you will need: Distilled Water It is vital to have a sterile water source with a neutral pH, free of contaminants.  Rose Hydrosol This is a beautiful way to deliver subtle rose scent to your resulting lotion.  Sweet Almond Oil This highly nourishing oil makes an excellent base for a handmade lotion.  I personally like to infuse the sweet almond oil with some rose petals before making this lotion but that is a completely optional step.  Rosehip Seed Oil Known for its wonderful absorption, this an exceptionally nourishing oil that offers an abundance of benefits for the skin.  Cocoa Butter Super rich and chocolatey scented cocoa butter adds some richness and deep moisturizing qualities to the handmade lotion.

72	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_52_1346111477-7	Do not use a stick blender to mix in the fragrance, or the batter may become too thick. Crisp Cotton Fragrance Oil does not accelerate trace in cold process soap.  If you are working with a different fragrance oil that does accelerate trace, add the fragrance oil after adding the colorants.  FIVE:  Split the soap batter into two even containers; it’s okay to eyeball it!  There will be about 3 cups in each container.  SIX: To one container, add all the dispersed Ultramarine Blue Oxide and use a whisk to mix in.  To the other container, add all the dispersed Titanium Dioxide and use a whisk to thoroughly mix in.  SEVEN: Pour about 1/4 of the white soap into the mold.  Tap the mold on the counter gently to release any bubbles.  EIGHT: Pour about 1/4 of the blue soap into the layer of white, moving the soap throughout the mold.  Pour from a few inches above the mold to cause the soap to “break through” into the white.  Don’t worry about making your pour “perfect.”  NINE: Continue to pour the white and blue soap into the mold from various heights.  As you continue to pour, the soap will begin to swirl itself naturally.	-0.0240484196692705
73	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_58_50212824-6	The next step will resolve this. Popular colors are white or bronze, but you can use any color you want.  Avoid using glitter.  Even the finest glitter may clog up your spray bottle.  5 Pour 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of distilled water down the funnel.  This will help knock loose any eyeshadow/pigment powder that got caught in the mouth of the funnel.  Make sure that you use distilled water and not tap water.  If you can't find any, then you can use filtered water instead.  Tap water contains too many minerals, which can affect your spray, as well as shorten its shelf life.  6 Consider adding some fragrance.  If you still have room in your bottle, you can add fragrance with a few drops of essential oil.  Essential oil is very strong, so you will only need about 20 to 25 drops.  7 Close the bottle and shake it.  Your shimmering body spray is now ready to use.  The ingredients will settle over time, so you have to shake it before each use.  Community Q&A Search Add New Question Question Would perfume be okay to use instead of essential oil?  Community Answer Yes, it would, however it may not be natural, a major selling point of essential oils, and it will not have the same homeopathic qualities.	-0.0281015075743198
74	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_55_59440734-5	With the introduction of stick blenders to soap making, the trace can be reached in a few minutes. The Spruce / David Fisher Add Fragrance or Essential Oils After the soap mixture is completely blended, but before it gets too thick, slowly add any fragrance or essential oils from your recipe to the mixture.  Stop stick blending the mixture and just use the end of the stick blender like a spoon.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Additives or Extras If your recipe calls for additives such as spices, natural exfoliants, flower petals, herbs, or special moisturizing oils, now is the time to add them.  As you did with the fragrance, gently stir them into the pot using the stick blender as a spoon.  Before you move on to adding the colorant, give the mixture a brief blend with the stick blender to make sure that the fragrance oil and additives are well mixed.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Color to the Soap Next, add color to the soap.  If you want the soap to be one single color, add the colorant to the pot and stir.  If you want to achieve a swirl effect, do the following: Ladle about 1/2 to 1 cup of the soap mixture into a measuring cup.  Add the colorant to that bit of soap.	-0.040446288883686
75	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone. Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing?  Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs?  Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer.  Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device?  If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone.  Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out.  This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying.  Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance.  What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs?  It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting.  Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	-0.0022997616324573

MARCO_11_1166150088-3	Choosing A Cell Phone Based On Features: OnePlus 7T Before choosing the phone if you know exactly what features you want, it will help you to make a better decision. If you know what features you want you can get a phone with all the latest features and functionalities if that’s what you’re looking for.  Or if you’re looking for a basic cell phone knowing what features you want ahead of time will help you to avoid spending too much money.  It will prevent you from buying a more expensive phone which has lots of features that you don’t want.  Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.  It would be better for you to get a smaller phone.  Display Screen: OnePlus 7 LCD The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen on cell phones has gotten better over the years.	-0.0039413878694176

Before you commit to a purchase, there are a few things to consider and evaluate.  Ensure that the phone that you want to purchase will work on the network that you wish to use.  Ensure that it is a GMS phone if you wish to use it on T-Mobile.  Also, evaluate any damage that may be present on the device.  Often, you can get a great deal on a phone if it has small, cosmetic imperfections that dont affect its functionality.  eBay gives you ample opportunities to ensure that what you buy is exactly what you want.  What is included when you purchase a phone on eBay?  What is included in the package upon delivery varies with each product.  Some phones include a charging cord, wall adapter, and even headphones.  Some only include the phone.  The eBay description will tell you what is included with each specific product.  This knowledge helps you to make an informed decision.

The only requirements are that the phone should be unlocked, not specific to a particular carrier, and it should be compatible with GSM Networks.  Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular.  Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone.  Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones.  If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display.  Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers.  Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them.  Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan.  After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward.  Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose.

The purpose of the subject line is to get the person reading to say three simple words: ""Tell me more.""  If you think about it, an email's subject is much like a company tagline.  Often, entrepreneurs will ask me about a tagline or more often, they will ask me to choose between two options.  The first one is usually descriptive, explaining what the product is, or does.

83	134_1-5	Tell me more about the Motorola Moto G7 Power.	MARCO_20_566276368-13	DIRE: The first one is dire (to say, to tell). In both English and French, we tend to only mention the COI and not the COD, because it is implied.  If we want to hear what someone has to say, we might just say “Tell me!”  The “me” is indeed a COI, because whatever is being told is the COD.  Let’s compare some examples: Il (me) dit toujours la vérité.  He always tells (me) the truth.  Je leur dis “bonjour !”  tous les jours.  I say “hello!” to them everyday.  Just keep in mind that you can translate dire as either “to say” or “to tell”, and this is influenced by the COD and COI.  For example, je le dis would be best translated as “I say it” and je lui dis would be best as “I tell him.”  DONNER:  The second one is donner (to give).  This conjugates like any regular -ER verb and is the best example of how to use COD’s and COI’s.  Remember that when substituting a COD or COI pronoun for a noun, you must place the pronoun between the subject and the main verb.	-0.0478597395122051

MARCO_33_97721069-6	Poor camera performance is to be expected with phones in this price range, but last year's Moto G7 phones could usually provide sharper photos in our testing. Should you buy it?  Samsung Galaxy A10e 7.5 / 10 Maybe.  I definitely enjoyed using the Galaxy A10e, thanks to its smaller physical size, great battery life, and lightweight design.  The software experience is very close to what you'd get on Samsung's $1,000+ flagship smartphones, and performance was acceptable.  It also works on all major US carriers, which is missing from Nokia's budget phones.  However, the lack of NFC support and a fingerprint sensor might be deal-breakers for some people.  As previously mentioned, Motorola is now selling phones for less money than the Galaxy A10e that have fingerprint sensors and full support for all US carriers — though you still won't get NFC for contactless payments.  The Galaxy A10e also has an extremely poor camera, but you won't get anything significantly better from the competition at this price range.  Buy it if: You want a Galaxy phone, but your budget is around $200.  Your priorities are hardware/software performance and battery life.  Don't buy it if: You take a lot of photos.  You need NFC support or a fingerprint scanner.	-0.0144147025421261

News Technology Phones Samsung Galaxy A10 vs S10 5G: two smartphones £1,000 apart What do you really get when you spend big on a smartphone?  We compare Samsung's cheapest and most expensive new models to find out By Louise Muyanja 20 Sep 2019 Share this page Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email One of the smartphones in the image above costs almost £1,000 more than the other.  On one side, the new A10 has had a facelift, with a sleeker design and larger display.  It costs just £140, which stands in stark contrast to the S10 5G’s eye-watering £1,099 price.  Previously, avoiding the lower end of the price spectrum could be excused if you weren’t a fan of chunky-looking smartphones with small screens and thick bezels.  But cheap phones no longer bear the look of ‘you get what you pay for’.  So what’s happening on the insides that can truly justify the extra cost?  I f you’re wondering whether it’s worth forking out or saving the money, we drill down into the key differences between the top-of-the-range Samsung Galaxy S10 5G and the bargain-basement Samsung Galaxy A10.	-0.0576653145253658
90	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_85160705-4	"While everything I love about the Moto G7 has to be worked through a filter of ""it costs $300,"" the screen is objectively good. It has nice, vibrant colors and acceptable viewing angles, and the touch responsiveness is similarly excellent.  My only complaint is a bit of ghosting while scrolling, but it's not severe enough to be a distraction.  The screen also works wonders for my still-favorite-after-all-these-years Motorola-only feature, Moto Display, which somehow has yet to be surpassed by any competitor's always-on display.  This feature debuted in 2013 and has barely changed in six years, and yet because it was so thoughtfully designed even back then it's stood the test of time.  Remarkable.  The G7 is also really well made.  There's no metal to be found in the frame here, but that's no detriment thanks to whatever grippy resin has been installed over the polycarbonate.  The front and back are adorned with Gorilla Glass 3, which may not be as scratch resistant as the modern variants, but it'll do the job unless you smash the thing to bits on concrete (a situation few phones can actually survive).  I'm also impressed with the design."	-0.0019180249655619
91	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_76429195-3	The Moto G7 has a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the affordable sticker price. A 6.2-inch Full HD+ display ensures all of your apps, games, and more look sharp and colorful, and the dual 12MP + 5MP rear camera combo takes pretty good photos all things considered.  You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10.  Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app).  And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers.  We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.  Pros: Build quality is great Large and colorful display Cameras are pretty decent Works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Alexa access is hands-free Cons: Doesn't have NFC Best Alternative Moto G7 Don't like the OnePlus 8?	-0.0023975218646228
92	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_78846660-10	The Moto G7 is equipped with 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 512GB), has a relatively snappy Snapdragon 632 processor, and a modest 3,000 mAh battery that should get you through a full day of normal use. Just like the G7 Power, the G7 also has the excellent Moto Display for quickly seeing notifications without turning on the entire screen, as well as Moto Actions for doing things like chopping the phone to turn on the flashlight or twisting it for opening the camera.  Software updates are also a concern here just like they are with the G7 Power, but we'd expect to see an Android 10 update here before it arrives on the Power sibling.  Pros: Glass design is really sleek Large, sharp display Dual rear cameras Storage is expandable up to 512GB Moto Display and Moto Actions are excellent Cons: Motorola's track record for software updates Performance is fine Best Mid-Ranger Moto G7 The best mid-range phone for TracFone.  The Moto G7 is an incredibly solid mid-range phone.  Its display, cameras, performance, and more are all pretty good for the money.	-0.0028534908778965
93	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-4	Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone. Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7.  For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.  The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	-0.0015760154929012
94	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-6	Pictures are sharper, so you can see finer details in things like leaves and bricks. In low light, the A50 brightens and punches up colors, while photos taken with the G7 are muddier with much hazier and washed out colors.  The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7.  I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.  The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame.  This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

95	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen. Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	-0.0021739201620221

MARCO_43_1625245214-4	"Another thing that I've done that has been really helpful for time management is using an app called Focus Time. I do a 20- to 35-minute sprint timed with Focus Time in the morning before the kids are even up.  When I get back from that, I pick the biggest work task of the day that I want to get accomplished, and get to it.  The most important aspects of life for me are health and family, so I focus on getting those managed well because when that is done, everything else naturally falls into place.  You have to decide what aspects of life and business are most important to you, get them running smoothly and allow your forward movement to fall into place.  5.  Approach every day as a school day.  When I coach entrepreneurs, I tell them, ""Fail forward and fail fast, and every day will be a school day.""

He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"".  Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin.  Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.  I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being.  ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody.  All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run.  I run in a void.

A phone is one accessory that most of us want to take with us on the run.  Whether you want to: listen to music or podcasts, use a fitness tracking app, snap pictures, make a call, or be ready for an emergency, there are plenty of purposes to carry your smartphone.  You can go out for a run without your phone.  However, there are excellent reasons to have a phone with you while you run: Safety: It’s a good idea to have a phone in your hands in case something goes wrong.  Fitness apps: Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Nike+, and others can keep that data you want from your workouts – and even help you find your way should you get lost.

MARCO_31_951513314-15	Whether you need to carry your iPhone when running to map the terrain, listen to music, or attend phone calls on the go, you can’t carry it in your hand. One slip and the glass sandwich will break from both sides, or the distraction could make things worse and lead to an accident.  The most common option would be carrying the iPhone in the pocket of your shorts, but the constant bounce can kill your rhythm, even it does just jump out of the pocket during the run.  Unless you’re wearing a running vest or a sports bra that comes with a slip pouch to place your device, your best bet is to get a running armband for iPhone.  Available in different materials and designs such as armbands, wristbands, and even waistbands for greater comfort, you can pick your favorite iPhone holder for running the easy way.  Is the best iPhone running armband safe to use?  We seldom get out of the house without our smartphones, so it seems obvious that you’d want to take your iPhone when you’re out on your daily jog.

102	134_2-1	I've heard iPhones look and feel great. Should I get an iPhone?	MARCO_50_1012198764-7	FEEL - This has become quite an important factor nowadays, since phones are no more used only to make calls or send texts. iPhones admittedly look great and for some it well justifies the premium they might pay for it.  So if looks do matter to you, get an iPhone.  It doesn't disappoint.  Design isn't perfect by me, but it definitely looks elegant.  2  . Integration - The Apple ecosystem is very seamlessly integrated.  Say, for example, you're browsing something on your iPhone, it gets synced through iCloud.  You can continue to browse that webpage on ANY other Apple device that you own.  This is just an example.  I know there are phones that have this feature but it's the execution part that Apple has done perfectly.  If you don't own any other Apple device, well, backups and all are still very seamless.  3.  Camera - iPhones have one of the best cameras in the market.  One of the, not THE BEST CAMERA (S7 has a better one).

So, yeah: That iPhone X may look great in the showroom window.  But ultimately, you're driving off the lot with the practical four-door crossover.  It's more affordable.  It gets perfectly decent gas mileage.  But it still has the same nice high-end navigation package, entertainment system and fuel-injected engine as that sweet low-slung coupe.  Not too shabby.  That's the iPhone 8.  The baseline 2017 iPhone remains a top-tier smartphone -- a seriously good phone.  Just don't expect it to turn heads.  Look, it's your $700, but we haven't reviewed the X yet.  Sarah Tew/CNET Should you get iPhone X instead?  The X is compact -- it's got a 5.8-inch screen in a body that's taller but barely wider than the 8 -- and it feels great.

Interface was better than android.  This article’s first reason is choices, choices and choices.  And that reason itself killed android from my list.  Who said too many choices is a good thing.  Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision.  A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me.  IPhone did that.  People don’t grow fans out of thin air.  There has to be stuff backing it.  Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years.  Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized.  So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones.  Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.  I am yet to test both phones but I am leaning towards IPhone.	-0.0058087352663278

And there are lots of apps to maximize camera settings as well.  Plus, Google Photos have unlimited storage, so it’s easier to manage.  The iPhone consistently gets praise for its great camera quality.  They take sharp and well-saturated photos.  The recent releases have cleaner Portrait Mode, wider angle than most Android cameras.  There are also a lot of great editing apps on the App Store to improvise any pictures.  Windows phones surprisingly have good quality cameras.

114	134_3-5	That’s more about phones than mobile platforms.	MARCO_17_930919582-8	These platforms also eclipsed the popularity of smartphone platforms historically aimed towards enterprise markets, such as BlackBerry. There has been an industry shift from feature phones (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume sales, to high-end flagship smartphones, which also enjoy higher margins, thus manufacturers find high-end smartphones much more lucrative than feature phones.  The shift away from feature phones has forced mobile network operators to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling-prices of flagship smartphones have had a negative effect on the mobile network operators, who have seen their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer feature phones.  To help make up for this, carriers typically use high-end devices to upsell customers onto higher-priced service plans with increased data allotments.  Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that include newer features and technology, and that smartphones were considered to be more relevant in present-day popular culture than feature phones.	-0.0041695809923112

Alright, alright, calm yourselves, keyboard warriors, we know this is something most of you would probably not agree with because let’s face it, with over 80 percent of smartphone market share in the world, the Android mobile operating system leads the rest of the competition by a mile.  Perhaps because it is the OS adopted by many leading brands of smartphones, fragmentation becomes an issue that plagues Android-powered phone.  Here is a post by Azzief Khaliq that argues for and against the effects of Android OS fragmentation you should check out.  Here, the Windows Phone’s fast and user-friendly OS plus its integration with Microsoft-linked products has given many users, particularly who work a lot with Windows products, a reason to consider the integrated mobile platform.  On the surface, it offers the same functionality (and perhaps a bit more) as do other platforms but these are 10 features that you may find better on a Windows Phone than on an Android.  1.

MARCO_58_920132313-2	"Now, with established platforms, popular devices and user's forced exodus from Windows-on-phone Microsoft isn't making another smartphone, even if you want one. But Microsoft isn't done with mobile.  What makes a mobile platform successful?  Nadella was probably right in his early assessment that there was no room for a third mobile platform in the traditional slate smartphone sense.  Nadella made later statements about bringing an ""ultimate mobile device to market,"" that is ""beyond the curve.""  This lends credence to the belief that his reservations about a third mobile platform were limited to refraining from competing in a market with entrenched rivals, invested users, an app store and developer economy that had passed slow-moving Microsoft by.  The current 11-year-old mobile infrastructure revolves around app ecosystems, strong developer and carrier relationships, OEM partnerships in the case of Google and Android, and premium hardware and software synergy for Apple.  From 2010 to 2015 Microsoft tried (perhaps half-heartedly) to adapt its mobile efforts to this infrastructure but failed miserably.  Microsoft ultimately realized there was no room for another smartphone platform.  And that's okay; smartphones are dead anyway.  Smartphones are dead Early ""smartphones"" were more ""phone"" than anything else."	-0.0120424376800656
117	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	-0.0079468982294201
118	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_58_1113525875-4	Walk The fastest way to get back into running is to slow it down. Even if that means taking regular walk breaks or signing up for a couch-to-5K walk/run training program, says Hamilton.  In fact, she tells all of her clients who have taken several months off of running to spend the first couple of weeks focusing on walking, not running.  (Try pairing your strength workouts with walking a few miles several times a week to get some miles under your feet.)  Because here’s the cold, hard truth: “If you don't have a long history of running behind you, you may need to start over at the beginning with your training,” she says.  This content is imported from Giphy.  You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  But don’t freak out.  You'll get back into the swing of things faster than you did the first time around, says Metzl.  Thank you, muscle memory!  Just be patient and listen to your body to know when it’s OK to ramp up your speed and/or mileage.	-0.0111483056098222
119	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_51_964601708-3	Here's what to do during your break. Make it last.  Take at least one three- or four-week break each year.  Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training.  Time it right.  The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes.  Stay in shape.  During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times.  For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started).  Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do.  For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout.  The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity.  In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness.  You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.	-0.0123764127492904
120	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_07_935369782-8	So it’s like running minus all the effort, which is what makes it a great cool down. Advertising If you’re wondering about the title of this one, it’s what I used to do when running in place back in PE class when I was a kid.  14.  Tae Bo We’ve all seen the videos.  At least those of us from the 1990’s have seen the videos of all the healthy people doing punches and kicks as part of their workout.  While doing this for awhile can be a great workout, doing them for a few minutes make them great cool down exercises.  This combines work outs with stretching in many cases, as you can’t really kick that high without stretching your muscles a little bit.  So it’s worth learning a few Tae Bo exercises for a more fun cool down experience.  15.  Yoga There’s a reason why yoga is considered exercise.  That’s because it actually is.  People can say what they want, but have you ever tried to hold dhanurasana for more than a few minutes?  It’s not easy.  Yoga poses can make great cool down exercises because they’re essentially complex stretches that wildly help your flexibility.	-0.0056539378128945
121	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_50_2479500095-11	So it’s not only great to include in your cool down exercises but also recommended since your core is, well, your core. 6.  Jumping jacks Now we get back into lighter exercises that also work well for cool down exercises.  A favourite is a jumping jack. 7.  Swimming If you have access to a pool at your home or your gym, a quick dip in the pool can be great for cooldowns. 8.  Get a Massage Okay, this one doesn't exercise on the face of it, but it can be effective as many cool down exercises.  The point of cool down exercises is to transition your body from exerting to rest.  Part of that is getting rid of pooled blood left over from when your veins and arteries pumping blood the body didn’t need anymore. 9.  Exercise specific drills This one is a little complex but bear with me.  If you’re a runner, you’ll obviously be working out your legs most of all.  So doing some squats after a run keeps your legs pumping without the stress of actually running.  These can be wonderful cooldown exercises. 10.  Exercise mimicry Now I’m getting into the complicated sounding stuff.  Oddly enough, it’s still not that complicated.	-0.0064848936162889

So really any stretch, exercise, or movement that can help you accomplish that task makes for a good cool down exercise.

126	135_1-7	Awesome. Can I do these strength routines and run on the same day?	MARCO_34_1286244718-7	However, as you get more and more advanced, this type of scenario won't work nearly as well since you're sending multiple mixed messages to your body. Monday's workout would tell your body it's time to get big, but then Wednesday's workout will kick your body into a bit of strength mode.  Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength.  What is a confused body to do?!  As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training).  It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances.  While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time.  The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.

Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.

Sure, there are lots of things to do at a ski resort if you don’t ski.  I personally don’t ski but have spent time at a number of ski resorts and winter holiday destinations around the world.  I know I am not alone, and wanted to share some tips on how to enjoy a ski holiday as a non-skier.  Often there is at least one member of a family, couple, or group that doesn’t ski but that doesn’t mean they have to just sit in the hotel room when everyone else wants to ski.  There are a lot of fun winter snow activities that don’t involve skiing or snowboarding such as sledding, snow tubing, ice fishing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and sleigh rides.  There are also tons of other fun wintertime experiences that non-skiers can seek out from exploring Christmas markets to relaxing in a thermal bath.	-0.0306548997759819

MARCO_30_89583066-5	The jump rope is small and does not take up much space, and you can even take it with you on vacation for a quick workout. Additionally, the exercise itself does not require much space, so you can exercise anywhere.  Also, you don’t even need much to warm up.  All you need to do is take 5 minutes to warm up with some light jumps followed by some higher intensity ones.  Wrapping up Overall, the jump rope is the best companion you can have when it comes to burning fat and building muscle.  Although some might come across as skeptical over its benefits, the jump rope has always been part of the main training session for many athletes and it brings numerous advantages.  It is beneficial not only in terms of weight loss and building muscle but also to help you maintain good heart health.  It is extremely versatile and engages all of your muscles, including your core, legs, and arms.  Most importantly, you can take it anywhere with you and practice either indoors or outdoors.  We believe that it is one of the most complex yet simple pieces of equipment you can have.  On top of that, it is quite fun to exercise with the jump rope!

While this is good news, there is also a downside to this, as the quality and condition of such equipment is not usually up to the mark and might even be downright dangerous in some cases.  In such circumstances, don’t keep yourself from performing your regular exercise due to the poor equipment quality.  Always keep a jumping rope with you every time you travel to tackle this situation.  6, It is Great for Outdoors Because of its high portability, jump ropes are an amazing option for those who love to work out in outdoor environments.  You can do it easily in your nearest park or any exercise course.  A lot of parks consist of bars for pulling up, and various other outdoor facilities, but you may work out all you need while combining different exercises with this rope.  7, It is All You Need A jump rope is truly the only equipment you actually need to stay healthy.	-0.0187748931348323

The second exercise is called nerve flossing.  The purpose of nerve flossing is to pull from one end of a nerve while keeping the other end of the nerve relaxed.  Nerve flossing pulls the nerve free from any entrapments or adhesions along its path.  For this exercise the patient is seated on a chair that his feet can be brought under.  This exercise is done with the affected leg (s).  First, the patient will tuck their head and draw their chin to their chest while flexing one leg at the knee under the chair.  The patient then slowly moves into the next position where their head is extended looking at the ceiling with their knee straight and toe pointed at the ceiling.  The patient slowly moves from one position to the other for 10 repetitions of the full cycle.

Simply remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and not any fad diet that you may find.  1.  Eat Healthy and Regularly Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight.  Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses.  Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals.  Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat.  If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.  The easiest way to adopt these changes is to prepare your food yourself, and staying mindful of what exactly you are eating.  2.

June 11, 2015 Santosh Badatya Keep your smartphone, tablet and laptop humming along by restarting only when you need to!  How often should you restart your smartphone?  The short answer is: not often at all.  Smartphones are designed to remain on all the time, broadly speaking.  After all, the idea of a ‘mobile phone’ is that you can always be contacted.  Of course you will need to restart your phone from time to time.  You will need to restart to install OS updates, if you are lucky enough to get them.  And on occasion if things are buggy and slow a restart will help.  You could manually shut down processes and apps, and that may solve your problem, but restarting does this job and also frees up RAM.  Usually that double whammy will solve any problems you are having with your phone.  As with any computational hardware, if your phone is suddenly running much hotter than usual it is worth trying a restart.  But if you are experiencing any of these regularly, there may be something wrong with your smartphone.	-0.0061841327697038

Certainly not more than once or twice a week, even when it is older.  Of course, how your device runs is only one part of the equation.  Power draw is the other.  Generally speaking restarting a smartphone will drain battery life, and switching off your phone overnight (and then restarting it) will use as much power as it takes to leave it on all the time.  Smartphones and tablets are designed to go to sleep and draw very little power.  So restart only when you need to.  How often should you restart your tablet?  In essence, for ARM-based tablets such as iPads and Androids this is the same as with smartphones.  Your tablet should be able to remain on pretty much all the time.  Restart it if things are getting slow or buggy, or if you need to complete a software install.  Other than that, let your tablet work and sleep as intended.  Things are different, although only slightly different, for x86 Windows tablets such as the Surface Pro range.

MARCO_51_971491333-3	“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.	-0.0040283021517097

Therefore, the intended training stimulus is rather low.  A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance.  Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores.  This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism.  The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles.  However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance.  At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health.  Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training.  This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast.  So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes.

MARCO_42_161899714-2	In fact, when you're doing a cardio exercise with food in your stomach, fat loss doesn't occur during the session but hours AFTER. On the other hand, when you do your cardio session with an empty stomach, you will burn more fat WHILE exercising.  So, Should I Do Cardio On An Empty Stomach?  It really depends on the length of the run.  If it's a short run (30 mins or less) go for it.  Research has shown that people who do cardio with an empty stomach will burn more fat while exercising but less fat during the rest of the day.  If you don't have enough glycogen (energy), your mind and your body will feel tired.  The lack of glycogen will lead your body to find energy somewhere else; both your fat and eventually your muscles (catabolism).  Indeed, a long cardio session (30 mins and more) with an empty stomach might have an impact on your muscle mass.  If you're doing a long run, get a little snack before.  It will help you avoid the catabolic state and make you get better results.  What Is A Catabolic State?  A catabolic state is when your body runs out of energy and use muscle tissue as a source of energy (muscle breakdown).	-0.0059360163286328

151	135_2-7	So what's a better alternative to running on an empty stomach?	MARCO_09_17958275-2	Is it better to run on an empty stomach? First, consider the time and effort.  If you’re running less than 60 minutes at an easy pace, you may not need to eat anything—your body has enough glycogen (its preferred fuel source) stored to power you through, but you should focus on refueling properly afterward.  Any run lasting longer than 60 minutes or performed at a vigorous to intense effort may require some extra fuel to keep you going.  That said, everyone is different and multiple factors influence this so if you find you’re hitting the wall on most runs around mile four or 45 minutes in, then you’ll adjust your fuel plan accordingly.  If you choose to eat before the run, in order to get that food in and digested, one option is to see if you can go to bed a half-hour earlier and then drag yourself out of bed thirty minutes earlier, which would give you time to digest a more substantial meal.  But, I realize how precious every minute of sleep can be, and also how difficult it can be to get in bed earlier, so here are some other ideas.

154	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_09_18864409-2	When we exercise, the opposite occurs; blood flow is redirected from internal organs to the large working muscles to provide the necessary energy for muscle contraction. When we have a large amount of food in our stomach, running is difficult or uncomfortable because our body is simply not designed to do both digestion and exercise at the same time.  Stomach cramps, stomach aches, or gastro-intestinal distress are the most common complaints when trying to run on a full stomach.  The mechanical mixing and jostling that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract too.  Now that said, some athletes are able to eat and run.  Endurance athletes train their bodies to eat on the run.  Even at the marathon distance, runners must ingest some nutrition during the race, although hardly a large meal.  Experimenting in your training with eating and running will let you know just how much you are able to eat before a run.  For the best training results though, allow three to four hours after eating before running, especially if the workout calls for some intensity.  All the best, Susan Paul, MS	-0.0071150260046124

MARCO_51_959902068-3	Eating Too Much Jonathan KnowlesGetty Images This should seem obvious, but it needs repeating: Avoid eating a big meal too close to the start of your run. We have all heard about the importance of carb loading for runners, but a big plate of eggs benedict—even though it’s loaded with many necessary nutrients—is not going to feel so good sitting in your stomach.  It’s important to time your nutrition for best results.  The digestive process slows down while we run and is unable to operate as usual because the normal blood flow to our gastro-intestinal (GI) system is diverted during exercise.  (The diverted blood flow is redirected toward working muscles.)  Therefore, if we eat a meal, especially a large one, food is not able to be digested normally, likely causing some sort of GI distress like cramping, side stitches, or worse.  If you are running first thing in the morning—for shorter runs—you may not even need to eat at all.  Running on an empty stomach for runs less than an hour is pretty simple for most.  However, if you are running later in the day, then it becomes increasingly important to watch your food intake.	-0.0091027505695819
158	135_2-11	So is it best to avoid running on an empty stomach as a leisure athlete?	MARCO_22_1470097179-2	How to Avoid Stomach Pain When Running 1) Do not Run on a Full Stomach You should not consume large amounts of water or consume 2-4 hours prior to workout. Sip small amounts (1-2 swallows) prior to and during exercise and wait to fully re-hydrate up until after the workout.  Dehydration can trigger cramping too, so do not overlook water/Gatorade during running.  Always sip a couple of swallows at regular intervals if running for more than 30 minutes and in hot temperature levels.  2) Decrease Pace and Breath Deeply Decline fast lane for a few minutes and continue deep breathing techniques throughout running.  A typical running series is a 3 action inhale and 2 step breathe out pattern.  Decreasing your pace will allow for you to keep up with that pattern.  As you increase to near maximum speed, your breathing will become more labored.  However, you can press through the pain and keep your speed if you concentrate on breathing deep by pressing your stomach out when you inhale and relaxing it as you breathe out.  3) Pre-Stretch With Side Torso Twists Pre-stretch before running by doing side torso twists.  Among the best methods to pre-stretch the location is to lift your arms over your head and lean to the left and right at the waist.	-0.0125324102118611

MARCO_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.  It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	-0.0159576218575239

MARCO_02_1721937567-12	The preserving of constitutional form and ritual as a hollow facade behind which to realize practices more and more dictatorial in their substance was a typical pragmatic adaptation made possible by the ability of the financiers to engineer the slow and gradual decline of the economy, avoiding upheavals of popular protest. But in retrospect there can be no doubt that Watergate was a coup d'etat, a creeping and muffled cold coup in the institutions which has extended its consequences over almost two decades.  The roots of the administrative fascism of the Reagan and Bush years are to be found in the institutional tremors and changed power relations set off by the banal farce of the Watergate break-in.  In the view of the dominant school of pro-regime journalism, the essence of the Watergate scandal lies in the illegal espionage and surveillance activity of the White House covert operations team, the so-called Plumbers, who are alleged to have been caught during an attempt to buglarize the offices of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate office building near the Potomac.  The supposed goal of the break-in was to filch information and documents while planting bugs.	-0.0244063287973403

A forceful presidential campaign therefore seemed essential to the president and some of his key advisers.  Their aggressive tactics included what turned out to be illegal espionage.  In May 1972, as evidence would later show, members of Nixon’s Committee to Re-Elect the President (known derisively as CREEP) broke into the Democratic National Committee’s Watergate headquarters, stole copies of top-secret documents and bugged the office’s phones.  Did you know?  Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein deserve a great deal of the credit for uncovering the details of the Watergate scandal.  Their reporting won them a Pulitzer Prize and was the basis for their best-selling book “All the President’s Men.”  Much of their information came from an anonymous whistleblower they called Deep Throat, who in 2005 was revealed to be W. Mark Felt, a former associate director of the FBI.  The wiretaps failed to work properly, however, so on June 17 a group of five burglars returned to the Watergate building.	-0.0254207216203212

MARCO_50_2128988370-69	Many people will say it was about Nixon lying about tapes made in the oval office of the White House that shows a conspiracy to cover up a break-in of the democratic room in a local hotel named Watergate. The rest of the story is that Republicans were caught in a break-in of the room, but Why were they trying to get in?  Because they wanted to get the proof that the democrats were offering sexual benefits in the room for major democratic donors.

If Dean's revelation is correct, it would change the popular understanding of the origin of the Watergate break-in.  That's no small claim.

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell.  At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty.  G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison.  Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC).  Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.  In it, he claimed that high White House officials had pressured the defendants to plead guilty.  The five who pleaded had perjured themselves at the urging of “higher-ups.”	-0.0080671673640608

One of the convicted burglars, James McCord, clearly not content with accepting such a prison sentence, wrote Sirica that perjury had been committed at the trial and the defendants had been induced by ""higher-ups"" to remain silent.  Subsequently, McCord suggested that Magruder, Mitchell, and Dean all were involved in the planning of the burglary and cover-up.  While McCord's assertion turned out to be only hearsay evidence, obtained from Liddy, the grand jury was reconvened, the prosecutors subpoenaed Dean, and the Ervin committee began focusing on the roles of Dean and Magruder.  To intensify the pressure on Dean, the prosecutors held long secret sessions with Liddy, and though Liddy steadfastly refused to discuss the case in these well- publicized sessions, the prosecutors intentionally promoted the story that Liddy was talking and implicating Dean and Magruder.  As President Nixon's transcripts confirm, the ruse succeeded: Dean believed that Liddy, who had attended meetings with him and Mitchell which eventually led to Watergate, was plea bargaining with the prosecutors."	-0.0094732521101832

168	136_1-7	Did Congress and federal prosecution get Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office?	MARCO_56_806901575-8	The Senate panel called a number of witnesses to testify -- including top administration aides like senior advisers H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and John Dean, Attorney General John Mitchell and Nixon assistant Alexander Butterfield. Perhaps the most surprising revelation that emerged from the hearings was the acknowledgement of listening devices and a taping system in the Oval Office, which were confirmed by Butterfield in his appearance before the committee.  The existence of such a taping system set off a protracted legal battle between federal courts and the president.  After losing his fight to keep the tapes private, Nixon eventually handed them over to special investigators who discovered an 18 and-a-half minute gap on one of the tapes, which audio experts later said had been deliberately erased.  To this day, no one knows what was erased, but most believe it was some type of incriminating evidence spoken by someone in the Oval Office -- mainly because it occurred at a portion of the tape where the Watergate investigation was being discussed.  Advertisement Ultimately, the tapes provided incontrovertible evidence that Nixon at one point attempted to obstruct justice by asking to use the CIA to shut down the FBI's Watergate investigation.  Months later, Nixon brought even more trouble upon himself when he ordered the firing of special Watergate investigator Archibald Cox -- presumably to get the heat off him.	-0.0051503833383321

Meanwhile, Congress intervened when the Senate organized the Watergate Committee to investigate the event.  Needless to say, the walls were closing in around Nixon, and it became much worse.  John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, was convicted of engaging in illegal activities by federal prosecutors.  When that information became public, Judge Sirica increased the pressure on the Watergate intruders.  In March, Sirica finally achieved his desired outcome when one of the intruders released information linking CREEP to the break-in.  The dominoes were now falling one by one.  In May, another convicted intruder testified before the Watergate Committee and revealed additional information linking not only CREEP, but the Nixon Administration to the events at Watergate.  Eventually, the Watergate Committee called on John Dean, who was Nixon's lead legal counsel, who testified to Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up.

The pressure on Nixon continued to grow strong, so much so that on October 20, 1973 he was moved to commit the ‘Saturday Night Massacre’.  Unable to shake Cox’s pressure, Nixon contacted Attorney General Elliott Richardson and ordered him to fire Cox.  Richardson refused and was himself immediately fired.  Nixon then turned to the Assistant Attorney General to fire Cox.  He too refused and was fired.

One tape, later known as the ""smoking gun"" tape, documented the initial stages of the Watergate coverup.  On it, Nixon and H. R. Haldeman are heard formulating a plan to block investigations by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that national security was involved.  This demonstrated both that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and that he had approved plans to thwart the investigation.  In a statement accompanying the release of the tape, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory.  Once the ""smoking gun"" transcript was made public, Nixon's political support practically vanished.  The ten Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who had voted against impeachment in committee announced that they would now vote for impeachment once the matter reached the House floor.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.

MARCO_02_337202498-76	"Historian Christopher Andrew concludes that ""Nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena. While the criminal farce of Watergate was in the making, Nixon's inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships both with Communist China and with the Soviet Union.""  Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a legacy of fundamental mistrust of government, rooted in Vietnam and Watergate.  In surveys of historians and political scientists, Nixon is generally ranked as a below average president.  During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct was comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than Clinton's.  Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate.  Olson suggests that legislation in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks restored the president's power.  Personality and public image Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it.  Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred."	-0.0044412785209715

Watergate burglars arrested, June 17, 1972 On this day in 1972, five men were apprehended while breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate, an office-hotel-apartment complex near the Potomac.  They possessed burglary tools, cameras, film and pen-size tear gas guns.  In rooms the menhad rented at a motel across Virginia Avenue from the burglary scene, police found electronic bugging equipment.  Three of those arrested were Cuban exiles and one was a Cuban-American.  Their leader was James McCord, a former CIA agent and a security coordinator for President Richard Nixon’s Committee for the Reelection of the President.  Prosecutors also charged E. Howard Hunt Jr., a former White House aide, and G. Gordon Liddy, a CREEP finance counsel, as accomplices.  In September, a federal grand jury indicted Hunt, Liddy, McCord and the four burglars on eight counts of breaking into and bugging the DNC headquarters.  Nixon, having proclaimed that no administration officials were involved, coasted to a second term.	-0.0029771076515316

MARCO_05_629335936-2	Late at night on Friday, June 16, 1972, a group of five men hired by Hunt and Liddy broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The DNC offices were located in the Watergate complex—five buildings holding offices, apartments, and a hotel in Washington, D.C.  The plan was for the five men to plant eavesdropping devices and copy important DNC files, with Hunt and Liddy keeping watch from the Watergate Hotel.  But thanks to a night watchman who alerted the police, the burglars were caught and taken to jail.  President Nixon insisted that neither he nor any of his aides had any involvement in the break-in.  But soon evidence began to emerge linking the burglars to Liddy, Hunt, and the White House.  One of the five men arrested, James McCord, was the security chief of CRP.  And when the police searched the hotel rooms where the burglars had stayed, they found $2,300 in cash, which was eventually linked to CRP.  Three months later, on September 15, a federal grand jury indicted the five burglars, along with Liddy and Hunt, and charged them with conspiracy, burglary, and violation of federal wiretapping laws.

Another argument for this belief is the idea of the Boltzmann brain, which argues that in an infinite multiverse, it should be tremendously more common for particles to randomly assemble into a brain that is having the exact same experience as you are having right now, than for particles to create big bangs.Ancestor simulations is a belief proposed by Nick Bostrom, a professor at Oxford University, he believes that, in the future, it will be possible to simulate the actions of all the neurons in the brain and simulate the sensory input to that brain with enough accuracy to convince the simulation that it is a real person.  For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds.

Other arguments for simulation theory come from philosopher Nick Bostrum and theoretical physicist James Gates.  In 2003, Bostrum suggested that advanced civilizations with massive computing power might decide to run simulations of their ancestors — us — and, given the sophistication of the technology, we wouldn’t know that we’re nothing more than computer programs.  Gates, meanwhile, found “error-correcting codes” — similar in principle to those used in Web browsers — while studying equations about electrons and quarks, said Scientific American.  Even more concerning if you’re worried about a universe simulation?  It’s almost impossible to prove we’re in a real universe because any “evidence” could be part of the program.  Evidence of a “Real” Existence?  Despite solid philosophical and theoretical arguments, a team from Oxford University has found reasonably solid evidence that our universe is more than a mobile application.  The proof?

So, whatever happens, happens – no harm can be done in a virtual world because nothing is real – not even you.

On the other hand, living in a simulation can mean that miracles are possible, magic can be expected and we really are limitless!

As it stands, the multiverse exists outside our current scientific understanding of reality.  Theoretical physics suggests a multiverse is a hypothetical grouping of multiple universes.  This means that our Universe could be just one tiny universe in a much larger multiverse where many, possibly even infinite universes, are contained.  Interestingly enough, even though much of multiverse theory is hypothetical or imagined, there is some scientific grounding to parts of it.  But where to begin?  First, not all scientists agree that the multiverse could exist—or that it’s worth exploring.  Second, there are actually a few different theories, each which can help to explain certain anomalies in our Universe.  (But could also break some currently known things.) Let’s focus on the eternal cosmic inflation theory.  This theory starts with the Big Bang.  It is suggested that as our Universe expanded into existence, it started off rapidly, then slowed—like when you inflate a balloon.  This rapid expansion created our Universe, but also other universes in a vast bubble-like multiverse.  While parts of the universe stopped the extremely rapid “inflationary” expansion and “budded off” to become normal space, large parts of the Universe have continued to inflate even now.	-0.0087441643700003

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in.  Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory.  For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering.  What Is It?  The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience.  These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously.

If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes.  The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically.  Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy.  In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.  In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own.  The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James.  However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	-0.0132514489814639

Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.”  So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him.  Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power.  We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great.  This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies.  Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	-0.0264483671635389

If you act shy in front of him, then he will have a more difficult time overcoming his own shyness.  Build your child’s self esteem.  Children who feel good about themselves are less likely to be shy.  Identify your child’s strengths and build on them.  Is he creative?  Is she athletic?

211	138_1-3	How do I build my son's self-esteem when criticism is unavoidable?	MARCO_51_197971232-22	Often, when people criticize online friendships, the main part of the problem they see is the potential safety issues affiliated with meeting someone online. This is a valid concern, but there are protective measures to take.  Be sure to talk to people you meet online through video chat before you meet up.  Meet in a public place and bring someone with you.  Online friendships aren't just made by adults, so it is important to be aware of the potential that your teenager might make friends online whether you know about it or not.  Many teensreport having one or more online friendships or friends that they initially met online.  If you are the parent of a teen that makes friends online, it is understandable and unavoidable that you will be concerned.  Your concern is valid.  When a teenager wants to find a way to meet an online friend in person, it's hard to stop them.  One of the things you can do is support them and accompany them when they meet an online friend for the first time.  That way, you can avoid the possibility that they might sneak out or do something equally as unsafe so that they can meet a person from the internet.  You can join up at the mall or in a café.	-0.0049553913995623
212	138_1-3	How do I build my son's self-esteem when criticism is unavoidable?	MARCO_34_510953277-6	Contemporary psychologists often call for a modified approach to storm and stress theory, which emphasizes that although many young people experience a turbulent adolescence, many others have the opposite experience. It ultimately depends on an individual's temperament, external circumstances, and experiences throughout adolescence and young adulthood.  The stereotype of a moody, conflict-prone teenager does have some truth to it, but the teenage years aren't an unavoidable sentence of irrational, unpredictable behavior.  Young people may experience slightly disrupted moods, new conflicts, and new potentially risky experiences, but they usually emerge into adulthood relatively unscathed.  Ways to Support Adolescents If your child or someone you know is entering into their teenage years, you may be wondering about the best way to support them through what can be a difficult time.  Teenagers can be subject to all kinds of new personal and school-related stressors, all while trying to navigate the new and challenging world of young adult life.  To support the young person in your life, try offering up a supportive, conflict-free environment in which they are free to express themselves and their concerns about the world.  While you might not always agree with them or their behaviors, it's important to be able to empathize with them and engage with their concerns and criticisms.	-0.0092267775908112

If the bullying is extremely severe, you can even discuss the option of changing schools.  6.  Appearance Problem: Girls want to look pretty, and the media has made an almost unattainable idea of beauty.  Her body is constantly changing as well, so adjusting to this can make it even more difficult.  Solution: Watch your teenager and make sure that she does not suddenly start eating too little or adopting strange diets.  Make sure she knows that these looks are just fads, and unhealthy eating habits can affect her for the rest of her life.  You should also make sure that she does not hang out with friends who have negative habits involving their appearance. 7.  Friendship Problem: While friends can make life worthwhile, they can also cause a lot of stress.  An ugly fight with a best friend can leave your daughter in tears.  Teenagers are still working to develop their social skills, so many teenage friendships are prone to mood swings and instability.  Solution: Let your daughter know that fights are normal.

219	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life. This might also result in inability to empathize.  These sites make kids prone to sensationalism.  A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall.  Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media.  A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison.  This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence.  However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships.  Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”.  After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody.  Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	-0.003342994954437

In extreme cases, the incidents of cyberbullying combined with the absence of  sufficient offline communication can lead to the development of depression.  ADHD and anxiety.  It may become difficult for a child to concentrate on one subject or remain  calm with all the distractions provided by the social media.  The children addicted to social networking websites may spend their time anticipating the next opportunity to go online rather than focusing on the task in front of them.  The researchers from the University of Glasgow suggest that the fear of missing out cultivated by the social media can easily lead to anxiety in children.  Lack of offline social skills.  Being able to communicate and convey one's thoughts in a clear  manner is an incredibly valuable asset that can help achieve success in a chosen career and facilitate understanding in the relationships.

MARCO_32_154714576-3	Furthermore, social media overload may lead to problems with self-esteem, particularly in teenage girls. “Many girls are bombarded with their friends posting the most perfect pictures of themselves, or they’re following celebrities and influencers who do a lot of Photoshopping and have makeup and hair teams,” Dr Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, says in an article for Childmind.org “If that’s their model for what is normal, it can be very hard on their self-confidence.”  Another reason why depression is associated with social media might be what psychologists call displacement – which means what teenagers are not doing during time that’s displaced by social media.  This includes mental health-boosting activities such as exercise, sleep and developing talents.  “If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness,” Dr. Hamlet explains.  “Yes, you get a little dopamine burst whenever you get a notification, or a like on a picture, or a follow request.  But those things are addicting without being satisfying.”  Sleep and low self-esteem One crucial thing that social media can displace is sleep.	-0.0035322436597198

MARCO_13_1743844487-4	Don’t let, “Take the trash out” turn into, “You always forget to do your chores because you’re lazy.” Critical self-talk mirrors messages that we absorb about ourselves in early childhood.  So, change the conversation to overcome issues with self-esteem for teens.  Esteem-Building Tips Besides rewriting the inner dialogue, help your teen take these steps to improve self-worth: Celebrate what they do well.  Focus on effort instead of perfection.  Reframe mistakes into learning opportunities.  Pinpoint trigger thoughts that cause low self-esteem.  Get adventurous and try new things.  Own their decisions and opinions.  Give back to others through volunteering.  Make wise decisions.  Support your teen’s growth and development by being generous with praise.  This doesn’t mean telling your son or daughter that they’re smart or good-looking.  It means diving into specific situations where they performed well (e.g. cleaning their room, getting a B+ on their math test.)  Use this descriptive praise to celebrate good choices and hard work.  Decision Making and Self-Esteem Decision making remains crucial to a teen’s success.  Yet, developing decision-making skills is an often overlooked process.  And it requires practice.  So, find decision-making opportunities and guide your teen through them.	-0.0042652590200304

And, most of all, how can we follow these same guidelines to set a good example for our kids?  How Social Media Lowers Our Teens’ Self-Esteem: It causes them to live in a world of self promotion No matter what they post, they measure their self-worth on how many “likes” or “comments” the post gets.  This turns the posting into an addiction and a determiner of their beauty, worth, popularity and validity.  If a post doesn’t get a lot of likes or receives a negative comment they may assume they must be uncool, stupid or not good enough.  How to prevent it: Encourage your teenager that their inner beauty, unique qualities and how they treat others are what more important.  Help them realize that anyone that measures their worth by their social media profiles, is not a true friend.  It makes them constantly compare themselves to others Social media provides a constant outlet for the trap of comparison which subsequently creates feelings of depression and low self-worth in many teens.  Pay attention to statements that use “like” and “as” from your teen.	-0.0052245040424168

MARCO_49_1710547978-7	But Newton was not very excited about the slow-tempo ballad that was “What A Wonderful World.” Newton was opposed to Armstrong doing the song.  In fact, he came to the late night recording session and tried to stop it – to the point where he had to be locked out of the studio while the session proceeded.  Music arranger/composer Artie Butler shown at work with Louis Armstrong, Las Vegas, Aug 1967.  Artie Butler and Louis Armstrong at work in a late-night Las Vegas recording session that was reportedly made easier by Armstrong's good-natured levity.  Recordings in those days were done “live” – with vocalist, band or orchestra, and any background vocals all recorded at the same time.  A recording session could run through dozens of takes to get everything just right.  Overdubbing was still rare then.

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures.  At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe.  Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion.  The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures.  It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.  It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time.  The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers.  Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back.  The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO.  During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives.  It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	-0.0020942201372236

243	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_13_972701974-6	Walking the Great Wall Today Most people who choose to walk the Great Wall of China today choose to walk either a small portion of it, or pick specific, picturesque spots to do a series of connected hikes. This is because many parts of the wall are very run down, and it’s not possible to walk all the way along the top.  In the areas close to Beijing, and other tourist hotspots, the Chinese government has invested a significant amount in the upkeep of the wall, making it a very pleasant, if challenging, hike.  The most popular parts of the wall lie near to the capital, including Badaling and Mutianyu.  Here you are likely to find the wall crammed with tourists in peak season, making it difficult to walk.  However, these sections are particularly well-maintained, and set among glorious scenery, with views over the forest.  For a day trek, the section between Jinshanling and Simatai is very popular.  This section only attracts tour groups at Jinshanling, and once you set off, you’re likely to meet very few people along the way.  The wall is crumbling and broken down in places, but remains accessible, and this 11km hike takes you through some of the region’s finest scenery.	-0.0026285641361027
244	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander. Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places.  In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders.  In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea).  The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire.  Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier.  It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads.  Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world.  In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	-0.0033705588430166

MARCO_58_1517960092-4	Despite its effectiveness, it was sometimes ineffective in keeping enemies out such as in 1644 when the Manchu Qing managed to remove the Ming Dynasty and establish a dynasty of their own. The final construction work done on the wall was back in 1878 in the later phases of the Qing Dynasty, which existed from 1644 to 1911.  The construction and maintenance stopped since the wall was rendered obsolete by more advanced weaponry such as fire and explosives.  The Great Wall of China Today The Great Wall of China.  Image credit: Marc van Vuren/Shutterstock Today, the parts of the wall that are still in good condition were erected or maintained during the Ming Dynasty.  Some sections have been renovated in recent times, while others have been destroyed.  Some of the best and most widely known sections from the Ming Dynasty include Jinshanling, Simatai, Mutianyu, and Badaling.  The Great Wall of China is a popular tourist attraction offering magnificent views, with several sections having been declared 5A-rated tourist attractions, which in the rating categories used by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism means these sections are among the most important and best-maintained tourist destinations of the country.	-0.0035656227264553
246	139_2-7	Okay. So what’s another famous landmark in Asia besides the Great Wall of China?	MARCO_18_1914156314-21	In addition to rebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu's reign. The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations, and forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone frontages.  From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang.  Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east.  The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian.  Behind this line of fortifications, the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia, generally secure from attacks from the north.	-0.020577635616064

MARCO_55_1239342073-2	For example, Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered General Mengtian to lead around 300,000 soldiers to protect the defensive line and build the wall after defeating the Huns. This project took more than 9 years.  In order to take care of the soldiers and make them feel settled, the court even arranged for widows to marry them.  Besides those soldiers, the Emperor Qin Shihuang also forced common people to join the construction of this project.  There were also many other dynasties taking the same actions.  In 555, Northern Qi Dynasty (550 – 577), the emperor used common people to build the wall from Xiakou to Hengzhou, which is more than 450 kilometers (280 miles) long.  In the Sui Dynasty (581 - 618 AD), the widows were also forced to work because all the male laborers had been used already.  The criminals were forced into labor as punishment.  Their hair would be shaved off and made to wear iron rings.  During the day, they were ordered to take turns patrolling the wall, while at night, building and extending the wall.  They were required to work for 4 years according to laws of Qin Dynasty.   How many people were needed to build the Great Wall of China?	-0.0313758179545402

The outlying buildings were completed in 1643.   Section::::Construction.   The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra.  Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.  An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above riverbank.  In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.  Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.  The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.   The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took efforts from 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.	-0.0094035798683762

In 2017, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel acquired an image trademark, the first building in the country to secure intellectual-property-right protection for its architectural design.   Section::::History.   The original building of the hotel was commissioned by Tata.  Its doors opened to guests on 16 December 1903.   It is widely believed that Jamsetji Tata decided to build the hotel after he was refused entry to one of the city's grand hotels of the time, Watson's Hotel, as it was restricted to ""whites only"".  However, this story has been challenged by many commentators who suggest that Tata was most unlikely to have been concerned with 'revenge' against his British adversaries.  Instead, they suggest that the Taj was built at the urging of editor of ""The Times of India"" who felt a hotel ""worthy of Bombay"" was needed.   The original Indian architects were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza, and the project was completed by an English engineer, W. A. Chambers.

Awaiting your revert.  Happy holidays!  Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well!  My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such.  It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another.  So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities.  I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing.  The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights.  Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	-0.0154169732704758

I was doing research on my impending euro trip in June/July 2019 for two weeks and landed on your site.  It would be great if you can help me plan the cities I should travel to as this will be my second trip to the continent.  I had a similar trip in June 2014 and visited Interlaken, Prague, Budapest, Zagreb/Plitvice and 7 days in Italy visiting Rome, Venice, Florence and Cinque Terre and flew home back from Milan.  I would love to travel again to East Europe covering Dubrovnik, Split, Lake Bled, Salzburg, Hallstatt, Warsaw however I would be repeating countries.  Should I explore somewhere else in Europe like maybe Amsterdam, Bruges, Paris, Spain and Portugal.  Or should I visit Greece along with Turkey.  Could you please suggest keeping in my mind the places I have already visited?  Awaiting your reply.  Reply Roger Wade says: January 4, 2019 at 6:33 pm Khushboo, You’ve been to some amazing cities and some of Europe’s best scenery already, so well done.	-0.0262081306427717

It is an ivory-white mausoleum built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal after her demise.  The Taj Mahal today is the resting place of both Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan.  The tombs are the centerpiece of the 17-hectare complex.  The Taj Mahal was probably completely built by 1653.  The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is today admired by the millions of visitors who visit the site.  It is not only one of the 7 wonders of India but also the world.  3  .  The Konark Sun Temple In Orissa The Konark Sun Temple is another one of the 7 wonders of India and is located in Konark, Orissa.  The temple was built in 1255 CE by the East Ganga Dynasty ruler, King Narasimhadeva I. The temple is famous for its fascinating architecture and erotic sculptures.  The main attraction is the sun-chariot-styled temple with elaborately carved wheels, walls, and pillars.  Though a major part is in ruins, what remains is enough to draw the attention of visitors to the Konark Sun Temple.  The temple is dedicated to the Sun God.	-0.0085126394405961
256	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization. The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan.  The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari.  Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute.  Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well.  Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders.  This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details.  The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	-0.0109588429331779

Taj Mahal, India One look at the Taj Mahal and it’s easy to see why it’s a wonder.  It’s considered to be one of the most magnificent masterpieces of architecture in the world.  Besides that, it’s also a symbol of love.  Don’t believe us?  See the Taj Mahal in VR for yourself.  The emperor built it in remembrance of his third wife who passed away giving birth to their 14th child.  Today the couple remains buried together beneath the main inner chamber of the Taj Mahal.  It took more than 22,000 workers, 1,000 elephants and 22 years to build this incredible structure.

MARCO_40_1229337887-2	However, there are now several different categories of the “Seven Wonders”, and knowing which ones are in each category can be most peoples first stumbling block. I recently wrote an article on the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World and the Seven Modern Wonders.  Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza.  All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time.  The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq.  The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters.  So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.  So the next time someone asks you to name the Seven Wonders of the World, your first question should be to ask which of the wonders.  Below we take a look at the Seven Natural Wonders of The World.	-0.0150966942310333

MARCO_49_1460908036-1	Influence of Nature in Architecture | Plan n Design Influence of Nature in Architecture nitikabanhani_76534 Updated on 2018-10-14 In Architecture Over the years architecture has been influenced by various factors apart from which era and when it has been established.  Various influences that we see are in the way a building has been constructed, i.e. the form of the building, the various structural elements of the building, etc. Nature has been one of the most evident influences in architecture and in various forms over the years.  Since time immemorial nature and the environment has inspired various aspects of our life.  The humbleness and the beauty of nature have been one of the most inspirational idea for the humans.  Small dwellings and the pattern of their arrangement have been inspired by nature.  Nature is an integral part of our lives.  Natural forms are not created by a single force or events; nor by the simple co-existence of many parts, it is the interaction of each part to its immediate surrounding that initiates processes.  Architecture is not far behind when it comes to being inspired by nature.  The examples of the same are quite prevalent all over the world, and over the centuries, from the pre-historic times to the present day, architecture and nature go hand-in-hand.	-0.0088358605280518

Architects need to make buildings that are friendly to the environment and more green which can be adaptable to the surroundings, in other words, they need to create buildings that are energy efficient, like green buildings or sustainable buildings which are designed to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and nature.  So they need to take into consideration: Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources Protecting residents’ health and improving people’s productivity Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradation Green buildings ( green architecture) are a trend these days for their positive effect on the environment because they take landscaping into account.  Green buildings also managed in the construction process to make sure that any waterways remain unpolluted with construction by-products.  Green buildings also have benefits that you’ll find luxury, like better indoor air quality.  Many studies have found that they also lend themselves to a better work environment.	-0.011358949355781

Design The complex exemplifies Wright's Prairie School ideal and is comparable with other notable works from this period in his career, such as the Robie House in Chicago and the Dana-Thomas House in Springfield, Illinois.  Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"".  Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century.  The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity.  — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"".

265	139_2-19	I like that philosophy. Form should follow function. Is the Taj Mahal an example of Organic Architecture?	MARCO_14_1277270212-6	Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called “the best all-time work of American architecture”.  Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.  His creative period spanned more than 70 years.  Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater, 1936-39: Fallingwater stands as one of Wright’s greatest masterpieces, both for its dynamism and for its integration with the striking natural surroundings.  It serves as a perfect example of his “organic” philosophy, whereby structures were designed in harmony with humanity and its environment.  Wright’s work includes original and innovative examples of many building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums.  Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass.  Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe.  His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio.	-0.0127508835867047

The house is a beautiful example of Wright's ongoing pursuit of the ""destruction of the box,"" and gives visitors a wonderful experience with its continuous open and flowing spaces and transparency .  Wright's invention of the transparent corner, which can be seen in the way the tall windows meet at a corner looking out onto the back porch area of the house, allows the interior space to have an even greater sense of openness and calm.  Another architectural signature of Frank Lloyd Wright is also seen in the fireplace, as it sits in the central portion of the house, making it a sort of symbolic architectural centerpiece.  While it does have many features that give a sense of open space, it also has many other interesting architectural features.    The front façade of concrete blocks has an almost fortress-like appearance to ensure privacy from the street.  The house is built with Way-Lite concrete blocks and Philippine mahogany trim.  It has a second story, rare in a Usonian house, with cantilevered balconies.  The living room has a built-in banquette facing a wooded scene through a wall of 10 foot high glass panes, symbolizing a transcendental pew set before the altar of nature."	-0.0249988809227943

It is not a country for the faint of heart.  On a good day, when our larger cities such as Abuja, Lagos and Kano are filled with the teeming masses going in so many different directions, flogged by the heat and sun, bumping down uneven roads all in the name of “the hustle,” it can appear chaotic.  On a bad day — and there have been some bad days since the terrorist group Boko Haram began its latest rampage with an April 14 bombing just outside Abuja, the capital, that killed more than 70 people and followed it three weeks later with a bombing that killed almost 30 more just a few paces from the first attack — Nigeria can seem like hell.  The darkest moment now upon us arrived after the group broke into a school in the remote town of Chibok and absconded with more than 200 young women who are said to have been handed over to Boko Haram fighters as sex slaves or sold in neighboring countries as wives.

Large cities such as Abuja, Johannesburg, Lagos, and similar others.  Wherever you are about to go, do some research on what to expect.  Travel smart and be aware.  Talking to random strangers ( in some parts of Johannesburg) might not a good idea.  Nobody is about to sell you some gold or diamond.  Stay away from strangers you don’t know.  I would not buy anything on the streets if you are not familiar with the area.  Be a good traveler and be aware of your surroundings in the busy cities.  I can’t stand traffic jams in big cities.  This is why I stay away from the metropolitan cities.  I can manage with average-medium size cities better.  All in all, it is really worth it.  There is no place like Africa.  You will find some of the friendliest and hospitable people in Africa.  We love to share our cultures, dances, songs, and many other unique traditions.  This is me at the King’s palace in Rwanda.

The former settlement's location was west of Arcola along the BNSF Railway near Houston Southwest Airport.  In 2014 the town site was no longer accessible by public roads.   Section::::History.   The town of Duke grew up on the Sugar Land Railroad as a shipping point for sugar cane.  Water from conveniently nearby Clear Lake was used to service the railroad locomotives.  Postal service began in 1883 with John R. Fenn as postmaster.  The bustling community consisted of a hotel, stock yard, store and sugar mills.  The town was named after Duke Hessey, who operated the store.  On October 19, 1888 there was a political rally at Duke that nearly resulted in violence between the contending factions.  During the tense political struggle which later erupted in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War there was an attempt at civil debate.  However, when Woodpecker candidate Kyle Terry took the stage at Duke, he had harsh words for his opponent Ned Gibson, a Jaybird.  Though Gibson was not there, one of his brothers took vigorous offense.  Terry brandished a pistol but was prevented from using it by an elderly African-American man, a former slave of the Terry family.	-0.0116957444697618

282	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-3	Akwa Akpa, also known as Duke Town to the British, became a center of the slave trade, where slaves were exchanged for European goods.  The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area.   Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.  By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.  They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.   Section::::Later history.   The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.	-0.036370150744915
283	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-4	"With the suppression of the slave trade, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports.  In 1846 a Christian mission was established by the United Presbyterian Church between Duke Town and Henshaw town, with the support of King Eyo.  The mission was headed by Rev. Hope Masterton Waddell with support from Hugh Goldie, who wrote an account of Calabar in his 1890 book ""Calabar and its Mission"".  That year the chiefs requested British protection for Calabar, but the reply from Lord Palmerston, received in 1848, was that it was not necessary or advisable to grant the request.  The British said they would treat the people of Calabar favorably if they would give up their practice of human sacrifice.  At the time, it was common for wives and slaves of an important man to be sacrificed upon his death.   On the death of King Eyamba in 1847, it was proposed that King Eyo become sole ruler, which the British favored.  However, the Duke Town leaders did not agree, and selected Archibong Duke as the new king.  In 1850, both kings agreed to suppress human sacrifice.   British influence continued to grow, as did acceptance of Christianity.  The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884."	-0.0471461787819862
284	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-1	Akwa Akpa  Akwa Akpa, known to European colonists as Old Calabar or Duke Town, was an Efik city-state that flourished in the 19th century in what is now southern Nigeria.  Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized.  The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar.   Section::::Origins and society.   The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger–Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.  One tradition says that Abasi's wife Atai persuaded him to let two of their children, a daughter and son, settle on the earth.  They were not allowed to breed, but disobeyed this injunction and became the ancestors of the Efik people.	-0.0530516691505909

Nigerian food offers a rich blend of traditionally African carbohydrates such as yam and cassava as well as the vegetable soups with which they are often served.  Maize is another crop that is commonly grown in Nigeria.  Praised by Nigerians for the strength it gives, garri is ""the number one staple carbohydrate food item in Nigeria""  a powdered cassava grain that can be readily eaten as a meal and is quite inexpensive.  Yams are frequently fried either fried in oil or pounded to make a mashed potato-like yam pottage.  Nigerian beans, quite different from green peas, are widely popular.  Meat is also popular and Nigerian suya—a barbecue-like roasted meat—is a well-known delicacy.  Bush meat, meat from wild game like antelope and giraffes, is also popular.  Fermented palm products make a traditional liquor, palm wine, and also fermented cassava.

288	140_4-4	Is eating fufu without chewing safe?	MARCO_48_1341675494-6	In Nigeria and Ghana, cassava flour is used in substitution for yams to make fufu (polenta), which then savored with stews. Cassava chips and flakes are also widely eaten as a snack.  Safety profile Cassava root contains natural toxic cyanogenic glycoside compounds linamarin and methyl-linamarin .  Injury to tuber releases linamarase enzyme from the ruptured cells, which then converts linamarin to poisonous hydrocyanic acid (HCN).  Therefore, consumption of raw cassava root results in cyanide poisoning with symptoms of vomiting, nausea, dizziness, stomach pains, headache, and death.  In general, cyanide content is substantially higher in its outer part and peel.  While peeling lessens the cyanide content, sun drying, and soaking followed by boiling in salt-vinegar water results in evaporation of this compound and makes it safe for human consumption.  Prolong use of monotonous cassava diet may lead to chronic illness like tropical ataxic neuropathy (TAN) and Diabetes, especially among rural and tribal inhabitants who purely engaged in processing and consumption of cassava products.

Centuries before the influence of Europeans, West Africans were trading with the Arab world and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and mint were not unknown and became part of the local flavorings.  Centuries later, the Portuguese, French and British influenced the regional cuisines, but only to a limited extent.  Jollof rice is a popular dish throughout West Africa.  The local cuisine and recipes of West Africa continue to remain deeply entrenched in the local customs and traditions, with ingredients like native rice ( Oryza glaberrima ), rice, fonio, millet, sorghum, Bambara groundnuts and Hausa groundnuts, black-eyed peas, brown beans, and root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, and cassava.

Ingredients Fried rice, jollof rice and salad, served with grilled chicken Jollof rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil, vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and scotch bonnet.  To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (purée) is added.  As seasoning spices, salt, seasoning/ stock cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used.  To complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish.

MARCO_37_1107517688-2	Surprisingly, Jollof rice didn’t originate from any of these two noise makers. Ouch!  Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).

Despite the variations, the dish is ""mutually intelligible"" across the regions and has become the best known African dish outside the continent.  Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire.  Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in ""linguistic, historical or political patterns"".  Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of ""blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy"" as well as the religion of Islam.  Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia."	-0.0031709410250186

Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria, but imported from Asian countries.  A second difference is the method of cooking.  The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content.  Party Jollof rice, is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations.  This dish is legendary for its smoky taste.  This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour.  A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavour.  Ghanian Jollof Rice Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice.  Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice.  Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell.  Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India.  The basmati rice is not parboiled.  Parboiling makes it soggy.	-0.0118008377030491

Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the ""Athens of Jalisco"", owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there.  Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador.  The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers.  By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region.  Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno.  Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated Convenios de Lagos.  The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s.

Temperatures are generally high and consistent, and seasons are more aptly characterised by the difference in rainfall than a change in the mercury.  For example, in Lagos, average temperatures barely range from 77°F (25°C) to 82°F (28°C).  June is the season with peak rains, while January hardly sees any by comparison.  In the south of the country, a coastal region that includes Lagos and the oil-rich area of Port Harcourt, it’s incredibly humid, but it rarely gets hotter than 90°F (32°C).  This area is defined by two rainy periods, one short period and one long period.  The long rainy season begins in late February or early March and lasts until July.

KILT_21385-11	Nigeria's seasons are determined by rainfall with rainy season and dry season being the major seasons in Nigeria.  The rainy season of Nigeria brings in cooler weather to the country as a result of an increased cloud cover that acts as a blockage of the intense sunshine of the tropics by blocking much of the suns rays in the rainy season; this in turn cools the land, and the winds above the ground remains cool thereby making for cooler temperatures during the rainy season. But afternoons in the rainy season can be hot and humid, a feature of tropical climates.  In the rainy season it is damp, and the rainfalls are usually abundant.

MARCO_38_1413844697-9	William Gormansays: January 28, 2013 at 7:57 pm                                 I just got notification that there had been a judgement against me in 2006. The proposed amount after compounded interest is $27,000.  This is the first time that I became aware of any judgement.  I moved, but still I thought they had a requirement to serve me or something of the sort prior to any hearing.  The second issue is that I have two incomes, both of which are exempt from this action.  The first being social security and the other my military retirement (w/disability adj).  These are my sole sources of income.  I had a period of alcohol abuse and gambling for which I have since sought treatment and recovered so I am not really sure whether the debt is legit or not.  What do you recommend I do?  If I offer them 20%, is that my starting point, or do I offer less and work up to that.  The funds will have to be borrowed, but I now have reasonable credit and can make it happen.

I will advise you to estimate.  It is important for the ideal amount you need and how fast you will be able to pay the money back will always help you to make the right decisions for the healthy financial habit.  What I Like About My Instant Offer There are a few factors that set this loan network apart from the others.  The lending process of My Instant Offer is very clean and it’s legit.  Their method of application is super easy and they even accept the joint application.  The company has a good rating from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and they protect how much you are getting from them and your privacy.  Their interests are very low and they also have some fixed rate that is the same.  They also offer you the opportunity of paying the loan on time to reduce the interest.  What I Don’t Like About My Instant Offer My Instant Offer does a great job of connecting people who need a loan to people who have extra money to lend.  However, not everybody has a good experience.  Some loan application is denied.  This is the main complaints borrowers have with them.  The loan is not available in some states.	-0.0511695407330989
327	141_2-1	So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?	MARCO_14_666207898-18	When trying to make money with Bitcoin using BTC faucets, it is very important to watch out for scams or “dead faucets”. A good rule of thumb is to avoid faucets without an active social media presence.  16.  Lend your Bitcoins If you already own some Bitcoin and are open to taking some risk, then making money with Bitcoin lending might be interesting to you.  As in traditional lending also, Bitcoin lending consists in lending your Bitcoin to a third party, usually through a lending platform, at an interest.  This interest is usually magnitudes higher than in traditional banking since the market is unregulated, and risk is significantly higher.  Some lending platforms pay up to 20% yearly interest.  That being said, you should never lend more Bitcoin than what you can afford to lose.  There have been several cases of Bitcoin lending platforms that defaulted or that were straight up ponzi schemes, and lenders ended up losing all of their money.  One notorious platform was Bitconnect, which promised guaranteed returns of up to 2% per day by supposedly using the money that you lent them to “trade digital currencies and make significant profits”.  When Bitconnect collapsed in early 2018, lenders lost all their money and countless lives were permanently destroyed.	-0.0356241837143898

This unique scheme was billed as ""for women only"".  Howe was arrested on October 18, 1880, by New York City Police and sentenced to three years in prison.

KILT_47185-1	"Ponzi scheme  A Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.  The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.   The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.   The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"".  Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate, and then stole the money that the women had invested.  She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens' 1844 novel ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" and his 1857 novel ""Little Dorrit"" both feature such a scheme."	-0.0513556152582168

Undoubtedly the most famous recent example involved Bernard Madoff, a New York financier who engineered a Ponzi scheme estimated to be in the neighborhood of $65 billion.  Madoff was eventually caught and sentenced to 150 years in prison, but not before pulling of what is essentially the biggest con game of all time.  Other Articles you Might Like Liked it?

The moment the situation is reversed, the scheme collapses.  The scheme gets its name from an Italian American called Charles Ponzi who in 1919 ran an investment scheme in Boston, which promised to double the investor’s investment in 90 days, later cut to 45 days.  Example of Ponzi schemes in India are Emu scheme : In case of the emu Ponzi scheme an investor was supposed to rear emus and then sell their meat, oil, etc. Speak Asia : In order to become a member of Speak Asia one had to invest Rs 11,000 and subscribe to the electronic magazine issued by the company called Surveys Today.  Member could participate in two online surveys every week and make Rs 500 per survey or Rs 1,000 per week.  So an investment of Rs 11,000 ensured that Rs 52,000 was made through surveys, a return of 373% (100% 52,000 – 11,000/11,000) in one year.

For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment.  Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ).  Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.  Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	-0.0021795106586068

How does it work?  The organizer will take an investor’s money and add it to a pool.  The only inflow of cash into the pool comes from new entrants.  Older investors are paid off with newer investors’ money, a cycle that can continue as more newcomers join.  The scam unravels when there isn’t any more cash coming in – unable to sustain payouts to older investors, the scheme collapses.

Ponzi schemes Source = Drwealth What is it?  Named after swindler & con artist Charles Ponzi, a Ponzi scheme (or Ponzi game) is a fraudulent investment operation wherein the operator or individual pays its initial investors from the funds that he raises from later investors rather than the profit earned through legal sources.  The operators of this scheme most often attract investors by offering short-term and higher returns than other investments.  No matter what the initial situation, the continuation of high returns and scheme requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors.  In 1920, Charles Ponzi became infamous for using the technique.  His original scheme was based on the arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps.  He diverted the money of later investors to make payments to himself and his initial investors.  Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme: When the scheme isn’t stopped by authorities, it collapses due to one of the following reasons: When the promoter disappears by taking away all the remaining investment money.  As the scheme requires continuous investments for funding higher returns, so once the investment gets slowed down and the scheme collapses since the promoter faces problems in paying the promised returns.	-0.0036273889709264
336	141_2-7	No, tell me how Ponzi schemes collapse	MARCO_30_127331614-3	This is just one reason the system could collapse. Another reason these Ponzi schemes disappear is because some of them are shut down by the SEC before they get to the stage of collapsing by themselves.  As soon as this system collapses, the owners envelop the same scam under the umbrella of another name and relaunch it.  You might be wondering why it is so easy for the owners to mask a scam under another name.  Simple.  The SEC shuts these programs down after they have determined a huge percentage of their revenue comes from the sale of adPacks and recruitment.  It takes a reasonable time span (months or years) for the SEC to have a proper analysis of the program’s income statements and then confirm they are operating illegally.  If you want to disregard my personal grudge with RevShare programs, that is fine.  Here is what the SEC had to say about Profit Clicking and another huge RevShare program, Traffic Monsoon.  These companies no longer exist under the same name and programs that follow this business model always end up shutting down.  Want to Build Something Long-Term?	-0.00304651632905

Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).  Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.  The wide gap between ""money in"" and ""fictitious gains"" make it virtually impossible to know how much was lost in any Ponzi scheme."	-0.0035720372106879

Pyramid Scheme There are many schemes having many similarities with Ponzi schemes but differ on some points.  Pyramid schemes are such schemes that appear legitimate businesses, but are pointed out by FBI as schemes that are fraudulent and ask common people to stay away from those schemes.  A pyramid scheme is so called because of every subsequent level being larger than the previous one.  So the founder sits at the top while new members are added to lower level.  The money that comes from new members goes up the order.  There is no sale of product or service, just like Ponzi schemes, and members at higher levels enjoy the fruits of labor of members in their down line as they remain involved in recruiting new members.  What is the difference between Pyramid Scheme and Ponzi Scheme?  Both Ponzi and Pyramid schemes do not make any profits by selling a thing or a service, but fund older members with money from new members.	-0.0043869214132428

MARCO_36_840746247-2	A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud whereby crooks steal money from investors and mask the theft by funneling returns to clients from funds contributed by newer investors. Bernard Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a $65 billion scam encompassing thousands of investors that was uncovered in 2008.  Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release.  Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds.  In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.  While it’s too soon to tell if last year’s total was an anomaly, some experts fear it could herald a return to more sinister times.	-0.0119824847206473

Other times, there is no product or service to sell at all.  Low start-up costs High start-up costs Legitimate Illegal Ponzi schemes You may have also heard of Ponzi Scheme s, which are closely related to pyramid schemes.  A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation.  Rather than pay investors from profits earned by the individual or organization, the organization pays investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors.  The payments tend to be very high, but to keep the high returns going, there would need to be an infinite flow of money from new investors.  So, much like pyramid schemes, Ponzi schemes inevitably collapse when they run out of new investors.  How can you avoid the pyramid scheme trap?  Ask lots of questions before you sign-up.

Beginning in 1986, Slatkin ran a Ponzi scheme for fifteen years, through an unlicensed “investment club,” where he promised a 24% return.  He stole $592 million from nearly 800 people, guilty of 15 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.

Ponzi schemes boom once and the bust makes it obvious there was never any value for the remaining people.  But BTC has boomed, and busted, massively multiple times - each time making a new high at the top and each time bottoming higher than prior bottoms (and the prior starting point for the boom).  Increased adoption IS what makes this more valuable.  That doesn't make this a ponzi scheme anymore than Facebook is.  It's the growth of the network that provides the value.

The bubble oscillates between high and low pressure at a high frequency, creating a distinctive and well-quantified sound.  The sound radiates energy, so the bubble eventually reaches equilibrium with its surroundings.     The frequency of the sound is well defined (Minnaert 1993) and depends on bubble radius, local pressure, local water density, and a geophysical constant.  The important observation is that the size of the bubble is inversely proportional to its resonance (ringing) frequency.  Larger bubbles ring at lower frequencies and smaller bubbles ring at higher frequencies.  The sound radiated is often loud and narrowly tuned in frequency (a pure tone).  But quickly, after just tens of milliseconds, a bubble in water becomes a quiet adult bubble and changes its role—it absorbs sound and is especially efficient at absorbing sound at its resonance frequency.

Expats who wish to enter into a long-term rental agreement will need a “garantia”; someone who lives and owns a business in Argentina who is prepared to guarantee that all rent payments will be made.  If you cannot find a guarantor, you may be required to make all rental payments in advance.  This can be risky and expensive.  Always ensure that you have access to cash and small change.  The majority of places will only accept cash payment, and there is a distinct lack of small change throughout Argentina; if you do not have coins in your possession, you may not be able to board the bus or pay for a taxi.  If you are a foreigner, you are expected to pay cash in full for purchasing real estate.  Expatriates who generate an income abroad are not required to pay tax when they transfer the funds into Argentina.  Many employers will tell you that you do not need a work visa to work for them.

All of this has helped the market to go from strength to strength where it has now expanded into new markets throughout the world.  What also makes sourcing wild red shrimp so unique is that the species has a reproduction cycle that is very short at just 12 months to 16 months.  This has enabled stocks to be managed because it has meant that it can be harvested without depleting resources and so, there is an element of natural sustainability to it.  Additionally, the government has introduced regulations and fishery improvement projects.  As far as fresh seafood goes, the demand for Argentine red shrimp has grown, and that is why it has now been added to the Meridian Sea product list.  To provide an insight into how much has been imported, in 2011, 200 MT was imported by the US, but now that has grown to 4, 500 MT proving just how much the royal red shrimp has grown in popularity.  Spain was once the largest buyer, but this has now changed as the frozen shrimp is now flooding into Europe.	-0.0030219147447496

MARCO_10_1345225280-2	Most American versions of whipped cream add both sugar and vanilla to the cream, which is essentially the same thing. This cream is credited to the chef Francois Vatel.  At the Chateau de Chantilly, Vatel supervised a huge banquet for Louis XIV and a reported 2,000 guests, where he created the now famous cream for use in pastries.  Sadly, Vatel would not be able to enjoy the cream's later popularity; his despair over the slow cooking of the fish resulted in him committing suicide later that night.  Most Americans know Chantilly cream as whipped cream.  The creation of Chantilly cream is thus tainted by Vatel’s suicide.  Yet few remember its origins, or if they do, prepare the cream because of its popularity, and as a way to honor the terribly misguided genius of Vatel.  Today, it is used throughout Europe in various pastries like eclairs, cream puffs, and it also may top ice cream.  In the US, Chantilly cream is relatively standard.  American cooks may also use the cream in French or Italian inspired pastries, or to top, fill, or frost numerous types of cakes.  The Fruit Basket cake, a golden cake, is layered with fruit and cream, and generally also frosted with the whipped cream.	-0.0346248149871826

And some were outrageously disgusting.  One time I was walking with my dad and this gay said something to me so offensive that my dad almost beat him up (I was about 17 years old).  Things have changed now quite a bit.  Most men have learned to be more respectful and they keep their comments to themselves.  Some do not say anything that is not solicited.  And a few will still say what-ever.  Argentine women do not pay attention to such comments at all.  They ignore them completely.  Some women answer back with expletives (not many however).  As a woman, I do like to receive comments (nice ones obviously).  And here in the United States, MEN DO NOT SAY ANYTHING AT ALL for fear of repercussion.  Then women here complain that men do not notice them!  So, my advice is this: Argentina is a country rich in culture, history and it is full of life and vibrancy.  Not to mention its natural beauty.  Each person's experience whether black or white will be different because each one of us is different.  We speak differently, we carry ourselves differently because each one of us is UNIQUE.

What Makes Argentine Beef Taste So Good?  July 24, 2017 in Argentinian Cuisine Argentinian beef has earned a reputation for being some of the world's best.  It's widely known for being incomparably tender and richly flavored, even though it's rarely seasoned with anything but salt.  So what makes Argentine beef taste so good?  The answer lies in the lifespan of the beef, from start to finish.  Grass-Fed on Las Pampas When the Spanish first brought cattle to Argentina in the 16th century, Las Pampas must have looked like paradise to them.  The 289,577 square mile prairie is seemingly endless and mostly flat, with a humid and temperate climate perfect for growing plenty of cow-friendly grass.  The many breeds of cattle introduced to Argentina thrived in the pampas, grazing happily and often, resulting in leaner, more flavorful and nutritious beef.  Whereas most American beef is grain fed, the bulk of Argentinian cattle feed on the plentiful grass, resulting in more omega-3 fatty acids.  That means Argentinian beef produces less risk of cholesterol or heart disease.	-0.0134173082187771
381	142_5-9	That’s sad to hear. Is there more on how the shift away from pampas-raised beef has had on its quality?	WAPO_XWC7DVRLCUI6TMAR3BIAMRG4TA-3	Here’s Argentina’s secret: Every additional 100 meters (about 328 feet) of altitude decreases the average temperature by 1 degree Celsius. That means grapes with higher acidity and softer tannins.  But the intensity of the sunlight increases as well, allowing the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness while the cooler temperatures keep the sugars in check.  The combination of low temperatures and high-intensity sun yields red wines of high intensity and extraction, soft and almost imperceptible tannins, and impressive structure and balance.  Altitude is only one factor in Argentina’s reach for quality.  “Our wines are wines of the sun, but also of the soil,” says Sebastian Zuccardi, third-generation winemaker at Familia Zuccardi in Mendoza.  He is also in charge of winemaking at his family’s Santa Julia winery.  It would be easy to say the Zuccardi wines emphasize quality, while the Santa Julia label offers value, but that would be oversimplifying it.  Both lines offer value and quality.  The Zuccardi family built a new winery a few years ago in the Paraje Altamira area of the Uco Valley, about a 90-minute drive south of Mendoza.  Zuccardi uses concrete tanks for fermenting and aging his red wines, believing that way he can produce malbec that is most expressive of its terroir.	-0.0028454076964408

MARCO_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners. In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real.  This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers.  Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell.  All this led to a sharp reduction in exports.  As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998.  Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy.  In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket.  Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime.  As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	-0.0034575224854052

MARCO_10_1319314585-2	The cooling effect of           altitude means that the grapes preserve acidity even when they are           allowed to hang for quite a while before harvest. But it would be wrong to dismiss Argentina’s other           wine regions.  Two in particular are worth mentioning.  First, Salta.  Up           in the hot north, these are the world’s highest commercial           vineyards: were it not for the effect of altitude, it would be too hot           for quality viticulture here.  Second, Patagonia.  Travelling far south,           this is a cooler, windier, flatter region that’s beginning to turn           out some really nice wines.  This tasting covered 45 different Malbecs, which sounds           like a lot, but is only a quick sampling of a much broader offering.  Some important wines are missing – Catena, Achaval Ferrer and Colomé,           to name but three – and so this can’t be seen as a true ranking of           Argentina’s best.  In terms of quality, I though this was quite high           across the board.  Remember, this is a mixture of commercial wines and           then some high-end ones.  Stylistically, I think Argentina would do           well to go down the road of freshness, definition and structure,           rather than super-ripeness and new oak flavours.	-0.0041102222166955

MARCO_54_1821438646-9	The truth is, they each have different things to offer, and if you’re going to make the effort to go the falls in the first place, you really should see both sides. Allow yourself two full days just for exploring both sides of the falls.  If you want to visit any other attractions in the area, such as the Itaipú Dam or Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, factor in an additional day for that.  How to Get to Iguazu Falls You have three options for visiting the falls: (1) tour Iguazu falls on your own by public transport; (2) go on an all-inclusive tour of Iguazu falls; or (3) take private transportation, but without a tour guide.  In my view, Iguazu tours are completely unnecessary and take all the fun out of exploring the falls on your own.  Large tour groups also clog up the pathways and can ruin the experience for other visitors, so I do not recommend this option.  If you’re staying in Foz do Iguaçu, it’s easy to reach the Brazilian side of the falls by taking the No. 120 public bus, which runs between the city, the airport and the falls.  Tickets cost less than four reais.	-0.0046387445181608

MARCO_30_152664236-7	Okay, I know I said there are a lot of things to do in Iguassu Falls besides viewing the waterfalls, but you have to make sure you give them ample time too. 11. Walkways Inside the Falls The Catwalk of Iguassu Falls The best way to explore Iguassu Falls is to stay at least one night at the Belmond Hotel das Cataratas inside the park.  It is on the expensive side, but it is the only hotel in the National Park and by staying here, you have access to the trails along the falls and the catwalk leading into the horseshoe at sunrise and sunset.  12.  Iguazu Falls From Restaurant Footpath Things to do in Iguassu Falls There is an excellent viewing point at the main restaurant where you can see them from above, plus take an elevator or footpath down to the catwalk to see them up close.  Iguassu National Park opens at 8:00 am and closes at 5pm, so if you are not staying at the hotel, you have no chance of witnessing sunrise or sunset over the falls.  We were out at the crack of dawn and until after dusk exploring Iguassu Falls virtually on our own.  We only saw one or two other people at the falls so we were free to photograph and explore in solitude.  It was an incredible experience.	-0.0052909110672771

From the Argentina side, you can follow a series of catwalks over the water rushing into Devil's Gorge.  Protective rain suits are provided.  There are some areas where it is possible to swim in the spray of the cascades, too.  Sightsee by boat: Iguazu Falls are packed with adventurous activities from zip lining to a ""Green Train"" that goes through the jungle, but perhaps the most exciting is riding in a boat at the base of the falls.  Jet boats departing from the Circuito Inferior and Puerto Macuco go right into San Martin—prepare to get drenched.  Get an aerial view: If you'd rather marvel at the natural wonder from above instead, consider a helicopter ride.  These 10-minute flights showcase the grand splendor of Iguazu Falls and cost between $100 and $150 per person, on average.

This grandiose city with wide avenues and a vibrant cosmopolitan flair is more generally European than Latin American in character.  Having little colonial architecture and few landmark buildings, Buenos Aires is chiefly a city of distinctive neighbourhoods that have their own meeting places, generally coffeehouses or bars.  This is a tradition rooted in the colonial period, when the centre of each neighbourhood was a general store and bar known as a pulpería.  These neighbourhoods provide a sense of community for people who live in an urban sprawl that by the early 21st century was growing twice as fast as the country as a whole.

In 1888 local Anglo-Argentines established the Hurlingham Club, based on its namesake in London.  The city of Hurlingham, Buenos Aires and Hurlingham Partido in Buenos Aires Province later grew up around the club and took their names from it.

There are food stands there that offer outstanding tamales and humitas.  These traditional Argentinian dishes (along with locro) originate from the indigenous populations in the North.

Mate Yerba Mate is a bitter, caffeine-rich tea served in a gourd, a “mate” and drank through a metal straw called a “bombilla.”  Everyone has their own mate gourd and thermos.  Gas stations have hot water dispensers next to the ice coolers.  It’s a large part of the culture.  Mate is best consumed with friends sitting in a circle passing the mate from person to person.  Mate isn’t something normally ordered in a restaurant, but if you’re anxious to give it a try a few restaurants do offer a mid-afternoon mate service (look up Las Cholas, La Cholita, and Las Cabras).  Ice Cream Helado!  The ice cream in Argentina is so good that it has converted this Blue Bell loyalist.  My hometown is home to Blue Bell Ice Cream and we take it very seriously.  Italian Gelato aside (because obviously) I never liked any other ice cream, but Argentine ice cream is special.  It’s creamy but also light, and any respectable ice cream shop will have at least 5 versions of Dulce de Leche on the menu.	-0.0060246535576879

Medialunas are another example since they obviously closely resemble a French croissant.  The word medialuna means “half-moon”, which describes the curved shape they have, like croissants.  Argentine medialunas are smaller than croissants, denser, slightly sweeter, and gooier.  They're often glazed with a rum-and-sugar mix but otherwise served plain.  While many Argentineans make them at home they're also available at bakeries throughout the country.  They are especially popular for breakfast – washed down with some strong coffee.  Medialunas are often served with sweet spreads like jam, dulce de leche, or chocolate.  As well as being perfect for breakfast they're also readily available for an afternoon snack when you need a hit of sugar.  Called merienda, afternoon tea in Argentina is definitely required when most people don't have dinner until 10 pm or later.  Swap out coffee with some yerba mate for a quintessential Argentinean merienda.  A plate of yummy medialunas ready to be devoured! 10.

This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.

In Argentina, the word ""Tango"" seems to have first been used in the 1890s.  In 1902 the Teatro Opera started to include tango in their balls.  Initially tango was just one of the many available local dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as theatres and street barrel organs spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European immigrants.  The development of Tango had influences from the cultures of several peoples that came together in these melting pots of ethnicities.  For this reason Tango is often referred to as the music of the immigrants to Argentina.   During the period 1903–1910 over a third of the 1,000 gramophone records released were of tango music, and tango sheet music sold in large quantities.  In 1910 the bandoneon was introduced to Buenos Aires from Germany and it became linked inextricably with tango music from then on."	-0.0205689948052167

Open banking is a banking practice that provides third-party financial service providers open access to consumer banking, transaction, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs).  Open banking will allow the networking of accounts and data across institutions for use by consumers, financial institutions, and third-party service providers.  Open banking is becoming a major source of innovation that is poised to reshape the banking industry.

Unsurprisingly, customers had to share usernames and passwords for each account with these aggregators making the whole system vulnerable to privacy risks.  Early “open banking” projects were scraping data from shared sources, but the records were often incomplete and provided only a partial picture.  These projects were difficult and expensive to support: If a bank decided to redesign its application, scraping became impossible.  Open banking APIs solve that problem by providing access to standardized data in a secure manner.  Payment Services Directive Explained So, what is PSD2?  The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a legal framework that regulates payment services through the EU and EEA (European Economic Area).  The directive supports innovation and development of an integrated payment market across Europe.  The new regulatory document was adopted in October 2015.  It was a logical extension of the original PSD, which was designed in 2007 to increase competition across the payment industry.

417	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_59_690617273-3	Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.	-0.0038879532366991
418	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_59_690617273-8	Platform banking, in contrast, is a digital marketplace, owned and operated by a bank or another third party, that provides banking and nonbanking services. As with open banking, sharing of customer data happens only with customers’ consent.  Moreover, platform banking also requires secure data transmission via APIs.  The premise behind platform banking is that banks can serve customer needs and offer services beyond their limited portfolios; it is a strategic response to serve customers better, engender more trust, and retain the customer relationship.  Open banking enables and amplifies platform banking.  Will the United States adopt open banking regulations?  The open data revolution is most evident in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries in the European Union.  Each has explicit regulations (Australia’s Consumer Data Right Act, 9 UK Open Banking Standard, 10 and PSD2) that require banks to share customer data with third-party providers as per customers’ instructions.

MARCO_56_419159361-14	This not only suggests to organizations that there is little revenue potential, but it also mean that it would be expensive to develop such a market. Consequently, relatively few organizations invest in and experiment with new products based on the new technology brought about through technological discontinuity.  For example, When Amazon started selling books online Barnes and Nobles and other brick and mortar booksellers discounted the new technology model and now Barnes and Nobles may be on the brink of bankruptcy.  Barnes and Nobles, Borders and other bookseller also believe that not many books will want to buy books online.  How can you buy what you have not seen?  The banking industry is also another example.  Although on-line technology has existed for some time, until recently on-line product innovation in the banking industry has been slow in coming.  One cause has been the difficulty in adapting banking to on-line technology.  Banks have to develop user software application, terminal equipment, and sophisticated communications facilities to mesh the technology into a product that consumers could easily use and also be able to have enough security built into the applications to protect users and bank’s asset.  Banks probably also believed that consumers would want personal contact with a human banker, due to the relative complexity and risk associated with financial products.	-0.0026148909237235

MARCO_29_1537139190-7	For the first time time, the banking industry can consolidate all internal and external data, building predictive profiles of customers and members in real time. With consumer data that is rich, accessible and financially viable to deploy, financial institutions of all sizes can not only know their customers, but also provide advice for the future.  This enhanced use of data will enhance the consumer experience, while increasing security and efficiency.  By moving from a rear-view-mirror perspective of customer communication to services deployed by robo-advisors and AI-driven chatbots, financial institutions will provide consumers with value through ‘next-best actions’ as opposed to blind selling of products.  The real innovation will occur when financial institutions integrate this capability with the expanded services of open banking and connected devices.  The reach of banks and credit unions can be expanded as virtual agents work on behalf of the consumer to find the best mix of solutions for each individual in real time.  This transformation may also result in the elimination of specific traditional products (checking, loans, payments) with the emergence of universal cash management solutions that address all needs in an integrated service.	-0.0032974891364574

M-banking is defined as “a feed where the consumer communicates with a bank using a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or personal digital assistant.  In that sense, it can be seen as a subset of electronic banking and an extension of internet banking with its own unique characteristics (Laukkanen & Pasanen, 2008).  It is one of the newest approaches to the concern of financial services through information computer technology (ICT), made possible by the extensive adoption of mobile phones even in low income countries (Anderson, 2010).

MARCO_22_1764140206-5	14] Regions in China, such as the Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, or Inner Mongolia contain an enormous amount of surplus energy available to mining operations. However, China has begun to exert regulatory pressure on provincial governments to encourage the closure of crypto-mines and has withdrawn incentivized tax deductions.  In combination to energy policy measures, China has consistently attempted to enact financial regulations on cryptocurrencies.  Notably, The People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, implemented measures prohibiting domestic Bitcoin exchanges and banning the practice of raising public funds for the development new cryptocurrencies.  Historically, China’s financial regulatory measures correlate with depreciations in Bitcoin’s value, most notably in 2014 when the price of Bitcoin in China fell more than 50% from its peak after the release the 2013 Bitcoin Notice.  [  15] Due to China’s high crypto-mining production rate, prominence of mining companies, and considerable level of Bitcoin transactions, a regulatory crackdown there carries the potential to impact the global cryptocurrency market.  However, instead of closing operations, we see mining operations transition to locations in North America and Northern European countries with looser regulatory environments and physical environments that favor the cost of crypto-mining production.	-0.0055960901081562

The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions.  Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.”  The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [  cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”  While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	-0.0015989864477887

The European Union Dogecoin is legal in the European Union.  The EU is one jurisdiction that appears to lack a clear focus when it comes to cryptocurrency regulations.  The top administration of the union has been giving mixed signals on the direction that should be followed.  The EU Central Bank was the first to fire the salvo by indicating that cryptocurrencies were highly volatile and risked causing huge losses.  It required the citizens to be extra cautious because the cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and could end up being hot bubbles.  However, the EU Parliament had a different view altogether.  The legislative arm of the EU indicated that cryptocurrencies represented the apex of the fintech and could not be simply wished away.  Instead, the parliament recommended comprehensive studies on cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin before a legal framework to regulate them gets installed.  On its part, the commission leadership is in agreement with the EU Central bank that the threats from cryptocurrencies are too dire to be left unattended.  The EU Commission Vice President, Valdis Dombrovskis, indicated that the risks associated with cryptocurrencies were clear.  According to the commission, these dangers include price volatility, the risk of complete loss, security failures and massive liability gaps.	-0.0017714299028739

MARCO_40_596728558-24	The regulatory environment also varies from one country to the next, with some nations delegating all crypto regulation to the EU and others taking a more hands-on approach. In April 2018, the EU Parliament voted to introduce tighter regulations for cryptocurrencies.  In an effort to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and terrorism financing, the regulations aim to tackle the anonymity of digital coins.  As a result, crypto exchanges and wallet providers will be required to register with authorities and introduce customer due diligence procedures, including identity verification.  As for what the future holds, we can find some clues in a July 2018 report from the EU’s Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies entitled “Virtual currencies and central banks monetary policy: challenges ahead”.  Referring to cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies (VCs), the report states that: “Policy makers and regulators should not ignore VCs, nor should they attempt to ban them.  Both extreme approaches are incorrect.  VCs should be treated by regulators as any other financial instrument, proportionally to their market importance, complexity, and associated risks.”	-0.0018792365444824

MARCO_21_189965382-4	There have been a number of high-profile cryptocurrency hacks and heists that have resulted in millions of dollars being stolen. Traders and investors have lost funds and some platforms have ceased to operate.  In the aftermath of these hacks, the price of particular cryptocurrencies has dropped considerably.  In a bid to counter the activities of these cybercriminals, traders and platform operators have to take a number of precautionary measures.  While some of these measures are indeed helpful, they create bottlenecks that hamper the cryptocurrency trading process.  This then creates a trade-off between security and efficiency.  Take for instance, the need to provide adequate security for cryptocurrency held in wallet storage.  Due to the activities of hackers, some traders prefer to store the bulk of their cryptocurrency holdings in offline wallets.  This means that anytime they wish to trade, they have to move from offline storage to online storage before participating in the trade.  This constitutes another hassle in an already convoluted trading environment.  Transactions on a blockchain are immutable and as such if funds get stolen, there is little chance of ever recovering such funds.  Cryptocurrency trading platforms constantly have to improve their security framework in order to stay ahead of the hackers and thieves.	-0.0295687280595302

KILT_56515839-5	Falcon Heavy flew in its reusable configuration, allowing for a landing approach of both side boosters and the central core.  The side boosters consisted of two previously flown Falcon 9 first stages, being reused from the CRS-9 mission in July 2016 and the Thaicom 8 launch in May 2016.  The central core was newly built because it needs to support stronger forces during ascent, so that a regular first stage could not be used.  The upper stage was the same as on a Falcon 9.   Side boosters equipped with a nose cone have different aerodynamic properties than the usual Falcon 9 boosters with a cylindric interstage.  For this reason, SpaceX equipped them with larger and sturdier grid fins made of titanium, to help guide the atmospheric descent accurately.  The central core, however, still used conventional aluminum grid fins, as its aerodynamic properties are very similar to those of a conventional Falcon 9 first stage.   The Roadster was mounted on the second stage using a custom-made payload adapter, and was encapsulated in a conventional fairing.

A first design of the Falcon Heavy included a unique propellant crossfeed capability, where fuel and oxidizer to power most of the engines on the center core would be fed from the two side cores, up until the side cores would be near empty and ready for the first separation event.  However, due to its extreme complexity this feature was cancelled in 2015 leaving each of the three cores to burn its own fuel.   Like the single stick Falcon 9, each Falcon Heavy booster core is reusable.  The Falcon Heavy Test Flight demonstrated the two side boosters landing simultaneously near their launch site, while the central booster attempted a landing on SpaceX's Autonomous spaceport drone ship, which resulted in a hard landing near the ship.  During the second mission all three boosters landed softly.	-0.0116188032552599

And on June 25, a Heavy launched the STP-2 mission for the United States Air Force, delivering two dozen payloads to orbit for a variety of customers. The two-stage Falcon Heavy consists of three strapped-together, modified first stages of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket.  The central core booster is topped by a second stage and the payload (s).  Click here for more Space.com videos...  Like the Falcon 9 and SpaceX's other spaceflight hardware, the Heavy is designed to be reusable.  During the February 2018 test flight, the two side first-stage boosters landed successfully but the central core did not.  The flight this past June had the same outcome.  All three first stages touched down successfully on the Arabsat-6A mission, but the central core, which landed on a ship at sea, toppled over on its way back to port, a victim of rough seas.  The STP-2 mission in June featured a different reusability milestone — the first payload-fairing catch by a SpaceX net-equipped boat.  The company has since snagged a second falling fairing and recently got another boat to potentially double its success rate.

444	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.  Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	-0.0266604553908109
445	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_54585305-1	List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters  A Falcon 9 first-stage booster is a reusable rocket booster used on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy orbital launch vehicles manufactured by SpaceX. The manufacture of first-stage booster constitutes about 60% of the launch price of a single Falcon 9 (and three of them over 80% of the launch price of a Falcon Heavy), which led SpaceX to develop a program dedicated to recovery and reuse of these boosters for a significant decrease in launch costs.  After multiple attempts, some as early as 2010, at controlling the reentry of the first stage after its separation from the second stage, the first successful controlled landing of a first stage occurred on 22 December 2015, on the first flight of the Full Thrust version.  Since then, Falcon 9 first-stage boosters have been landed and recovered 43 times out of 51 attempts, including synchronized recoveries of the side-boosters of the Falcon Heavy test flight, Arabsat-6A, and STP-2 missions.   , 22 recovered boosters were refurbished and subsequently flown a second time, including B1046, B1048, and B1049 which conducted three missions.  Eight Block 5 boosters are potentially available for future reflights.	-0.0271050315350294
446	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	MARCO_18_3116878569-7	In March 2013, SpaceX announced that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first-stages as controlled descent test vehicles, with plans for over-water propulsively decelerated simulated landings beginning in 2013, with the intent to return the vehicle to the launch site for a powered landing—possibly as early as mid-2014. The April 2013 draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed SpaceX South Texas Launch Site includes specific accommodations for return of the Falcon 9 first-stage boosters to the launch site.  Elon Musk first publicly referred to the reusable Falcon 9 as the Falcon 9-R in April 2013.  In September 2013, SpaceX successfully relit three engines of a spent booster on an orbital launch, and the booster re-entered the atmosphere at hypersonic speed without burning up.  With the data collected from the first flight test of a booster-controlled descent from high altitude, coupled with the technological advancements made on the Grasshopper low-altitude landing demonstrator, SpaceX announced it believed it was ready to test a full land-recovery of a booster stage.  Based on the positive results from the first high-altitude flight test, SpaceX advanced the expected date of a test from mid-2014 to early 2015, with the intention of doing so on the next Space Station cargo resupply flight pending regulatory approvals.	-0.0278135556727647

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.

Each of these engines had a sea-level thrust of 556 kN (125,000 lb f) for a total thrust on liftoff of about 5,000 kN (1,100,000 lb f ).  The Falcon 9 v1.0 second stage was powered by a single Merlin 1C engine modified for vacuum operation, with an expansion ratio of 117:1 and a nominal burn time of 345 seconds.  Gaseous N 2 thrusters were used on the Falcon 9 v1.0 second-stage as a reaction control system (RCS).  SpaceX expressed hopes initially that both stages would eventually be reusable.

453	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	-0.0008837846689857

MARCO_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel.  However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant.  So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene?  SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines.  And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature.  It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).  It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets.  When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars.  However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable.  So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	-0.0013673489447683

MARCO_28_970280486-8	SpaceX has traditionally favored dense, easy to handle propellant (LOX/RP1) and simple engine designs (the Merlin is a simple gas generator cycle, rather than the more efficient [  but more complex] staged combustion design used by most other modern rockets).  As such, it makes sense that they would go for the easier to handle and simpler solution of a methane rocket rather than the high performance but difficult and complicated liquid hydrogen motor, so long as the methane provides them with the performance that they require (which will remain to be seen).

456	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	-0.0019915525335818

An idea originated by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 is that hydrogen-fueled engines could theoretically have much higher performance than hydrocarbon-fueled engines if a heat exchanger were used to cool the incoming air.

Cheap imitations are easy to spot because they are made from lower quality parts, such as cheap PVC materials and the use of water bottles rather than steel containers.  These don't stand up well to the temperature changes and constant jarring of on-road use, which can cause them to crack and break.  Also, they are often tricky to install, do not easily adapt from petrol to diesel engines and produce less hydrogen for the price, while reputable manufacturers provide high quality, adaptable generators.  One liter of hydrogen per minute represents an acceptable performance.  Faulty Electrical Wiring If a car gas saver is wired incorrectly, there is the risk of fire and explosion created by sparks or moisture getting onto the faulty wiring.  There also is the possibility that other electrical components will suffer interference from the generator, which could create hazards during driving.

Section::::History.   In the first ten years of SpaceX, the company developed a variety of liquid-propellant rocket engines, with at least one more of that type under development.   , each of the engines developed to date—Kestrel, Merlin 1, Draco and Super Draco—had been developed for initial use in the SpaceX Falcon family of launch vehicles—Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy—or for the Dragon capsule.  Each main engine developed by 2012 has been Kerosene-based, using RP-1 as the fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer, while the RCS control thruster engines have used storable hypergolic propellants.   In November 2012, at a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, United Kingdom, SpaceX announced that they plan to develop methane-based engines for their future rockets.  These engines will use staged cycle combustion, for higher efficiency similar to the system used on the former Soviet Union's NK-33 engine.

Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants in a gas-generator power cycle.  Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage, and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.  The Merlin engine uses a pintle injector that provides deep-throttle capability used during Falcon 9 landings.  Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump .  Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine.  It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump, and is fed only by tank pressure.  The engine is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, and is radiatively cooled on the exhaust nozzle.  The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.	-0.0024221388157457

This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ISP and better system performance.

MARCO_22_1413901484-2	"This means that both engines have roughly the same outer dimensions: the 429 is 34 inches by 30 inches by 30 inches, and the 460 is 34 inches by 27 inches by 30 inches. These massive engines certainly weighed plenty, however.  The 429 weighed in at 635 pounds, while the 460 was an incredible 720 pounds, living up to its ""big block"" heritage.  Obviously, the physical size of the engine displacement is reflected in the names of the engines.  Production Run Though both engines began their lives in 1968, the 429 was discontinued in 1973, while the 460 lasted all the way until 1996, seeing use exclusively in trucks.  However, in 1973, the 460 underwent a massive change, dropping from a robust 365 horsepower to a paltry 209 horsepower.  It was finally discontinued due to demands for a more efficient engine to respond to the newly environmentally aware consumers.  Stroke Length This is where most of the difference between the engines is made up.  The 429, with less displacement volume, had a shorter stroke length of 3.59, meaning it produced less power per camshaft rotation than the 460, which had a stroke length of 3.85, as mentioned above.  The longer stroke produces more power and also allows for more and better high-performance modifications."	-0.0130515592172741

Even though the two mowers would be able to compare in terms of functionality, a modern approach gives the former machine a better edge.  Consider the better stability and ease of use on the new Staris, and it gets the crown in this battle.

This engine can manage a speed of 3600 rpm and is powered by a hydro drive system.  Coming in a V-twin engine configuration, that is sure to generate enough power needed for some of the most tasking commercial operations.  The S-series is much different and broader in its engine offerings.  Two models in this series use a Kohler ECV730 engine supported on the Electronic Fuel Injected system for better fuel management.  Yet another two models carry a Kawasaki FXV730V while the last one is being run on a Kawasaki FX651V engine.

In response to the anomaly, NASA and SpaceX jointly formed the CRS-1 Post-Flight Investigation Board.  Preliminary information from the post-flight review board indicates that the Engine no. 1 fuel dome, above the nozzle, ruptured but did not explode.  The burning fuel that exited before the engine was shut down caused the fairing rupture, as seen in the flight video recordings.  Subsequent investigations revealed in a Congressional hearing pinpointed the issue as a result of an undetected material flaw in the engine chamber jacket, likely introduced during engine production.  During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber.  This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure.

476	144_2-17	Why do open cycle rocket engines exhaust fuel?	MARCO_19_1767990244-25	Due to the laws of thermodynamics, as air is compressed, it is heated up. The air in the bow shock compresses so much it actually turns into a plasma.  This plasma can be about half as hot as the surface of the Sun.  Superheavy Bowshock So in order to avoid having this burning hot plasma destroy the rocket, the Falcon 9 will again light up 3 of its 9 Merlin engines to slow itself down just as it begins to really experience those extreme atmospheric temperatures.  This not only slows the booster down, but it also basically creates a “force field” in front of the booster, providing a boundary of exhaust gas which is a lot cooler than the plasma.  Without this step, the Falcon 9 booster would likely not survive the reentry process.  Parachute recovery attempts After all, SpaceX tried to recover the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 boosters using parachutes for the first few flights, which kept failing, likely due to a complete lack of additional heat shielding.  By the time the booster was supposed to deploy the parachutes it was too late.  Because it is hard to deploy parachutes when you are in a million flaming pieces.  But again as we mentioned before, this is something that stainless steel should allow the SuperHeavy booster to forgo which will save fuel and thereby increase overall performance.	-0.0030518644489347

MARCO_01_686831562-18	76] Technical feasibility Prior to the reusability program's success in December 2015, the return of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished, and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility. And even after this success, the rapid reuse of a rocket has not been attempted.  Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.  [  6  ]  [  77] Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.  [  78] Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return, vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin.  A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an expendable configuration.  Although the reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets [  28] it is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation.	-0.0028171159792691

Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it’s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX’s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4).	-0.0032650516368448

The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly.  For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior.  It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart.  Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe.  A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea.  As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae.  “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.  Lewis and his colleague Luke Nothdurft published their observations recently in the journal Coral Reefs.  Coral provide shelter for the tiny photosynthesizing organisms, which in turn produce excess sugar that the animals can eat.  Without that food supply, coral may starve.	-0.0076765064150094

April Flowers for redOrbit.com – Your Universe Online The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the world’s largest coral reef, and the only living thing on Earth that is visible from space.  The Great Barrier Reef is approximately 3000 kilometers long and up to 65 kilometers wide in some places.  According to new research from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS ), the Great Barrier Reef has lost half of its coral cover in the last 27 years.  The research team attributes this loss to storm damage (48%), crown of thorns starfish (42%), and bleaching (10%).  “We can’t stop the storms but, perhaps we can stop the starfish.  If we can, then the Reef will have more opportunity to adapt to the challenges of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification,” said John Gunn, CEO of Aims.  According to Dr. Peter Doherty, one of the program’s creators, this is the most comprehensive reef-monitoring program in the world.  AIMS started broad scale surveillance of more than 100 reefs in 1985.  By 1993, the program was incorporating more detailed annual surveys of 47 reefs.	-0.0098779667168855

Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by warmer-than-normal water, causing them to expel symbiotic algae that live in their tissues, from which they get their energy.  Coral turns completely white when it bleaches.  If it remains bleached long enough, it dies.  One scientist has already gone so far as to declare the Great Barrier Reef is now in a “ terminal stage .”  Most of those studying the reef agree that what is happening is unprecedented.  This is because, at a minimum, two-thirds of the 1,400-mile long reef bleached out last year, which led to 22 percent of it dying.  Now another bleaching event has resulted in at least two-thirds of the reef bleached again.	-0.0140095865353941

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	-0.0023187911137938

This what-if question is not some farfetched scenario.  The threats to coral and coral reefs — which include climate change, pollution, coastal development, fishing and the creation of jewelry and souvenirs — are very real.  In fact, live, growing coral on Caribbean reefs has declined to just 8 percent of the reefs' composition, compared with more than 50 percent in the 1970s [  source: IUCN Facts ].  So what happens if the coral reefs vanish completely?  Some experts predict hunger, poverty and political instability as the livelihoods of the peoples of entire countries disappear.  Once the coral is dead, the reefs will also die and erode, destroying important marine life spawning and feeding grounds.  Animals that rely on coral for protection and cover, such as grouper, snapper, oysters and clams, would also be negatively impacted.  And because this marine life is a vital staple in many peoples' diets, the death of the coral reefs would exacerbate the problem of feeding these groups [  source: Skoloff ].	-0.0032828745897859

It’s only a matter of time until the last coral vanishes from the oceans.  But what if an abrupt heatwave destroyed all of the reefs overnight?  Coral reefs take up just 1% of the world’s marine environment.  So, no big deal, right?  Wrong.  Just that 1% is enough to sustain a quarter of all marine animals in the ocean.  Two million species live in, on, and around the reefs.  For them, corals have been providing food and shelter for 50 million years.  The day the reefs disappeared, marine biodiversity would suffer huge losses.  The ocean bottom would be taken over by forests of seaweed.  Maybe it’s time to give jellyfish soup a try, since there would be plenty of them in the ocean.  But for many unique species of fish in the ocean, corals are their only safe habitat.  A lot of them would be lost for good.  Same goes for sea turtles.  Since coral are filter feeders, they clean the water.  Remaining species, including dolphins, would be left to survive in very murky waters.  They might soon disappear as well, since when the corals disappear, there would be very little fish for them to feed on.	-0.0129627184942364

Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.  The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.  Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.  Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves.  Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life.

489	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	-0.0197432357817888
490	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_51_2007527708-13	Thus, the net effect above the calcification tissue is a continuous production of excess CO 2. Allowed to accumulate, this would soon slow down calcification. The removal of CO 2 from the coelenteron by the abundant zooxanthellae in the upper gut wall accelerates the process of calcification.  Ultimately, as calcium and bicarbonate continuously migrate into the polyp, excess CO 2 is created by the process of calcification.  Thus, the presence of corals in a highly photosynthetic reef environment, where free-living algae are rapidly removing CO 2 -producing tissue and continually losing carbon-rich fragments to the lagoon, prevents the damping of calcification by accumulation of the products of the reaction.  Thus, the algal symbiosis in stony corals is not just an evolutionary device that internalizes energy and nutrient cycling, it also enhances both community calcification and photosynthesis.  Effectively, stony corals capture calcium and bicarbonate (alkalinity) from the overflowing ocean water and convert it into accumulating calcium carbonate skeleta, releasing carbon dioxide.  The released carbon dioxide is then taken up by the free-living algae that are typically abundant on coral reefs.  There is no net accumulation of biomass, by algae or corals, as this is lost by grazing and predation with subsequent outwash to the lagoon or deep ocean ( Adey, 1998 ).	-0.0254366435110569

MARCO_25_595279481-15	There's some of these bigger things like it causes erosion, can create weaker corals, they grow more slowly, but then also that this additional carbon dioxide can cause corals to bleach at even lower temperatures than what we've seen in other environments. Is that correct?  MARK EAKIN: Exactly, that's it in a nutshell.  You've got all of those plus some additional things like the larvae not being able to find the reef and things like that.  So yeah, it's a major problem.  HOST:  So given that there are a lot of problems out there and a lot of threats, negative impacts to our corals reefs, I'm going to ask you both this question because I hope that there's something a little more positive we can leave folks with here.  What is being done to address some of these problems?  JENNIFER KOSS:  So in the Coral Reef Conservation Program, we’ve chosen a policy, about seven years ago, where we narrowed our actions in terms of what we were going to do to put resources on the ground and in the water and so we narrowed down our actions to address the three main threats to coral reefs and that would be again, fishing, land-based sources of pollution, and climate change.	-0.0339978449046611

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	-0.0195544585585594
493	145_2-1	What happens when corals die and the carbon falls into the ocean?	MARCO_14_1269887941-9	When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO 2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity.  As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.  When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter.  Coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.  Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too.  As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.  Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome.  When change occurs rapidly, species can become extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations.	-0.0208017136901617

495	145_2-3	How can we stop coral bleaching?	MARCO_13_493381323-1	25 Ways To Prevent Coral Bleaching 25 ways to prevent Coral Bleaching 1.  Support reef-friendly businesses.  Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.  How many different species live in reefs?  What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms.  Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology.  When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs.  5.  Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	-0.0025436684954911
496	145_2-3	How can we stop coral bleaching?	WAPO_QW5NQT5NKZEFPPQK4MOYKW2DGI-2	So how can we stop the destruction of coral reefs? Step one is to deal with localized threats.  Coral mortality caused by ocean warming is widely misattributed to pollution, although there are a handful of places where sewage and sediment are indeed degrading reefs.  Impacts related to intensive tourism, mostly caused by anchors or people standing on corals, also need to be managed.  I’ve spent a lot of time underwater, removing plastic bags and fishing gear from corals, even on some of the Caribbean’s most remote reefs.  Off the south end of Abaco Island in the Bahamas, for example, the water is crystal clear and the fish, including large sharks and barracuda, were plentiful.  Yet nearly every colony of golden elkhorn coral we encountered was shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Most of the world’s tropical reefs have already warmed by 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit, causing corals to “bleach” and die during hot summer months.  Corals literally turn white as they expel symbiotic algae living in their tissue.  Ongoing coral loss and the catastrophic warming projected for the end of the century is fueling the search for more direct solutions to the coral problem, including actions that local communities can take to save their own reefs.	-0.0047489712014794

WAPO_7f1700ed8be36cf75c1091228312fee7-2	“I think that is clearly the impact of rising temperatures.” How much has the sea risen over the past century and a half?  A lot.  And it’s surging faster than ever.  “There is robust evidence that sea levels have risen as a result of climate change,” Australian government research has found.  “Over the last century, global average sea level rose by 1.7 mm [  0.067 inches] per year, in recent years (between 1993 and 2010), this rate has increased to 3.2 mm [  0.126 inches] per year.”  In all, the sea has risen roughly 20 centimeters since the start of the 20th century.  “The rate of sea level rise over the last century is unusually high in the context of the last 2,000 years,” the Australian report added.  But it’s not just the last 2,000 years.  It’s the last 6,000 years, according to this recent study.  And now, the rising sea levels over the last 100 years, is “beyond dispute,” Lambeck told the Guardian.	-0.051276795566082
499	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	MARCO_17_541106127-15	Between 1750 and 2000, surface-ocean pH has decreased by about 0.1, from about 8.2 to about 8.1. Surface-ocean pH has probably not been below 8.1 during the past 2 million years.  Projections suggest that surface-ocean pH could decrease by an additional 0.3–0.4 units by 2100.  Ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society.  Effects of acidification The effects of ocean acidification can already be seen and have been happening since the start of the industrial revolution, with pH levels of the ocean dropping by 0.1 since the pre-industrial revolution times.  An effect called coral bleaching can be seen on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, where ocean acidification's effects are already taking place.  Coral bleaching is when unicellular organisms that help make up the coral begin to die off and leave the coral giving it a white appearance.  These unicellular organisms are important for the coral to feed and get the proper nutrition that is necessary to survive, leaving the coral weak and malnourished.  This results in weaker coral that can die more easily and offer less protection to the organisms that depend on coral for shelter and protection.	-0.0559372827410697

""Three severe bleaching events in five years is not something we anticipated happening until the middle of the century.""  Climate change could kill all of Earth's coral reefs by 2100, scientists warn Warm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching, which is when corals turn white as a stress response to water that is too warm.  This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color.  Read More Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately.  But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.  Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching.  What he saw was unprecedented.  ""For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,"" he said.  Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching."	-0.0682099163532257

MARCO_18_438706474-27	Bikepacking Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.

The Basics Given that this is our complete guide to bikepacking bags, we’ll begin with a few definitions for beginners.  Let’s first clarify the difference between bikepacking and bike touring.  Although neither are mutually exclusive — and there’s inevitably plenty of overlap — the two often diverge in the style of travel they encourage.  Traditional touring tends to be enjoyed on heavily laden bikes, and as a result, often gravitates towards paved routes and byways.  Minimal in style, modern bikepacking is based more on the exploration of off-pavement roads, backcountry trails, and singletrack.  Furthermore, the two are largely differentiated by the style of bag setup they’re associated with, and the bikes that are used.  Traditional touring uses racks and panniers; as a result, touring bikes bikes are designed for this purpose.  The beauty of bikepacking is in its simplicity: any bike can be a bikepacking bike.  Thanks to the advent of soft bags, bikepacking doesn’t depend on a particular frame having eyelets for racks and panniers.  Full-suspension, carbon, ‘cross, hardtail, fat, rigid — almost any bike will do.	-0.003219898790121

Seat pack-  These teardrop-shaped bags attache to the seat post and saddle rails with straps and velcro.  Seat packs usually hold 8-17 liters of gear.  These often act as a compression sack.  They are great for storing your sleeping bag and clothes.  Many models have attachment points on the outside where you can strap additional gear like a cook pot or sandals.  In addition to the three primary bags, a number of smaller accessory bags are also available which can add some extra capacity.  Some bikepackers attach a 5-8 liter drybag to each side of the forks.  Some riders mount gas tank style bags to the top tube for an extra liter or two of storage space.  Feed bags mounted to the handlebars are also a good way to store food or extra water bottles.  What Are Racks and Panniers?  Panniers are large rectangular bags that attach to metal racks on the front and rear of the bike.  The racks bolt directly to the frame.

My goal with this post is to help you understand how these two different systems – rack and panniers versus bikepacking bags – work, and how to approach choosing from amongst the wonderful array of options for your next pedal-powered adventure.  Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).	-0.0029946980066597
506	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_06_890080970-6	Most pannier racks sit over the back wheel, attached to the bike near the rear wheel axle and rear brake bridge. Pannier bags then clip on either side.  There are options for extra bags that sit on top of the rack, or you can leave it empty and simply strap extra cargo to the top.  Some bikes also have fittings for racks either side of the front wheel which can hold bags as well.  The bags themselves have a firm back for structure with clips that securely hold onto the metal frame of the racks.  Pannier bags are water resistant or waterproof and are constructed from tough materials to protect your things in the event of a crash.  Many feature handy straps for carrying the bags by hand once you get to your destination and reflective detailing to help you stay seen in low light.  Pannier bags can carry more any cycling rucksack and there is no more comfortable way to carry a heavy load - after all, it's the bike carrying it, not you!  Using rucksack might have benefits for off-road handling, but it is not ideal for touring holidays when you are riding for longer with a heavier load.

More on this later.  Panniers can’t be mounted to every bike Panniers require a rack to be mounted on.  Racks require braze-ons or rack mounts on the frame attach the rack to.  Not all bikes come equipped with the proper braze-ons for mounting racks.  For example, you shouldn’t mount racks to carbon fiber framed bikes because the weight of the panniers can cause damage to the frame.  Often times it is impossible to mount frames to full suspension mountain bikes due to the design.  Bikepacking bags can mount to any bike.  Your bike components won’t last as long when you use panniers Because you are carrying around more weight, you are putting more wear and tear on your bike and components.  Wheels, chains, cassettes, tires, and brake pads all have to work harder when you are carrying around more weight.  These items wear out faster and need to be replaced more often.  This costs money.  Maintenance will also be required more frequently.  You must distribute the weight of your gear evenly on your bike while packing panniers If all of your heavy gear is packed on one side, the bike will not be balanced and handling will suffer.	-0.0017936823423951

Can You Put a Pannier Rack On a Road Bike Road bikes are not much different from touring bikes, which is why the answer to this question is yes.  You can put a pannier rack on a road bike, or even a mountain bike for that matter, as long as the mounting holes are compatible.  However, you may still have follow-up questions, which is why we’re going to take a closer look at this matter.  A road bike does not have a fixed structure.  Some have eyelets, while others do not.  The length of the chainstay also differs.  Lastly, different materials can be used on the bike, resulting in different weights.  By considering these factors, you can find out how you can put a pannier rack on a road bike and which can be considered as one of the right pannier racks for road bike.  With or without eyelets – To begin with, if your road bike has eyelets, attaching a pannier rack is quite simple.  However, if there’s no eyelet, you should get racks that have clamps or brackets for the seat post.  With this component, installation is much easier but less secure.	-0.0018097466090694

In Holland, parents are encouraged to take their children cycling from as young as 6-9 months, so even young children can join in on the fun.  Safety seats for really young children are usually mounted onto the handlebars.  Thus, bike seats are perfectly suited for smaller babies and toddlers.  When it comes to choosing the perfect seat for you and your family it’s important to opt for a safe and secure model that will protect your child and ensure his or her safety throughout the ride.

The Shotgun is the best seat for you if: You want the thickest padded seat for your little grom You want your child to have their own handlebars Your bike’s top tube is wider than 2″ The Do Little is the best seat for you if: You plan on using the seat with other bike styles, such as a cruiser or bike with a step-through frame You want the child to sit as low as possible on the frame.  On most mountain bikes, the Do Little sits slightly lower than the others.  The Mac Ride is the best seat for you if: You plan on switching the seat between two or more bikes regularly You want adjustable height footrests Casual Use All of the seats we listed above will work for casual riding, but the Tyke Toter and the UrRider are better suited for casual riding.  Both seats are bulkier and include integrated handlebars for the child.  On the flip side, they are easy to mount and are more affordable.

Perhaps, most importantly, Marvel solves its villain problem in spectacular style, with Josh Brolin’s Thanos being both the driving force of the movie and a plausible bad guy – his grand plan is clearly deranged, but there's a weird, twisted logic to it.  And without Infinity War there could be no Endgame.  1.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  Here it is.  The best Marvel movie.  The Winter Soldier set a new precedent for the MCU.  The Captain America sequel is a totally different take on the universe – a ’70s Cold War thriller that doesn't put a foot wrong.  Hell, The Winter Soldier should be named one of the best Marvel movies of all time for the elevator scene alone; a moment so memorable it was homaged in Avengers: Endgame.

Avengers: Endgame directors Joe and Anthony Russo revealed the truth about Katherine Langford's mysterious role on a recent episode of MTV's Happy Sad Confused podcast.  They said that Langford's scene as an older Morgan Stark was meant to mirror an iconic Thanos and Gamora scene from Infinity War.  At the end of that movie, Thanos is briefly transported to a metaphysical realm after using the Infinity Stones, and there he reunites with Gamora as a little girl.  Similarly, Tony Stark was meant to also enter this metaphysical realm after using the Infinity Stones to stop Thanos in Endgame, where he was supposed to be reunited with Morgan as an adult.  Marvel It certainly would have been a hugely emotional scene, but it wound up being too confusing for test audiences, since Katherine Langford had never been introduced in the movie's universe before this point: There was an idea that Tony was going to go into the metaphysical way station that Thanos goes in when he snapped his fingers, and there was going to be a future version of his daughter in that way station.	-0.041596308350563

T'Challa presents Wakanda's anti-isolationist shift to a United Nations-style government body, announcing that his nation will now be open to sharing their resources with the world.  Of course, remembering that as far as the rest of the world is concerned in the MCU, Wakanda is a third world, underdeveloped country, he's met with some confusion--all while his new friend CIA Agent Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) smiles knowingly from the back of the crowd.  The stinger doesn't overstay its welcome.  T'Challa isn't actually shown dropping the proverbial Vibranium bombshell on the poor unsuspecting world leaders, but the implication is enough.  The landscape of the MCU, both politically and technologically, is about to change in a major way.  This is a deceptively important detail, especially given the MCU's upcoming movie slate.  With Wakandan tech made more accessible, the landscape for both superheroes and civilians is about to take a major leap forward--and it's a safe bet that not every change will be positive, especially with the possibility of villains appropriating new tech too.	-0.0083900596946477

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future.  This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task.  While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward.

All 4 Avengers movies have great characters, stories, character interactions, visuals and some of the best action in the MCU.  Iron Man 2 and 3 develop Tony’s character really well and have decent action within, WS + Civil War create a more ambitious political character driven plot with tons of heart and great team ups and action and Guardians 1 and 2 just take everything I want in a great movie and combine it all beautifully (aside from a great villain in Guardians 1 and maybe too much humor).

So much for loyalty, Thor.  Marvel Entertainment Although the dozens of films in the Marvel Universe has made it difficult to see clearly, most of the self-contained “trilogies” still follow traditional narrative character arcs.  Trace just the protagonists, and you’ll see that Captain America evolves from a loyal patriot ( Captain America: The First Avenger) into a disillusioned rogue ( Captain America: Civil War ).  Tony Stark, who kickstarted the MCU, grows from over-confident, Ayn Rand capitalist fantasy ( Iron Man) to a compromised futurist ( Iron Man 3) whose outlook could almost be coded as socialist.

The other avengers will continue, so it is premature to determine the character arc for them.  6.Black widow - Her arc seems incomplete for me because we do not know her origin story.  Her characterisation has not been the central point of plot, instead, she was piggy backed on other avengers story.  We saw her in Iron Man 2 where she wasn’t central character and was used as a plot twist.  In captain america winter soldier she played an important role that was having larger screen presence.  Though the movie was best in the MCU her character played second fiddle atleast according to me.  The only thing that was observable other than her spy, action heroine stuff was the subtle romance between her and bruce banner.

536	147_1-11	Okay, what is the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise?	MARCO_19_1827124190-3	This is a franchise that started with a story about a man building a high-tech suit of armor, and it’s since evolved into a galaxy-spanning macrocosm that includes time travel, Infinity Stones, and talking raccoons. Phase 4 looks to explore that universe even further, while also venturing into some previously unexplored corners.  One thing to note: Feige hasn’t revealed exactly when Phase 4 will be ending, so some of these later, undated projects may wind up actually classified as Phase 5, whenever that may be.  In the meantime, here’s our roundup of everything we know about Marvel’s future plans.  Black Widow (May 1, 2020) Marvel Studios' Black Widow Credit: Marvel Entertainment Black Widow may have met her end in Endgame, but Scarlett Johansson is reprising her role as the morally complicated spy in a solo movie.  The character has appeared in multiple Marvel films over the last decade, beginning with Iron Man 2, but Black Widow (directed by Cate Shortland) puts her front and center.  “Where we find Natasha in her life at this point is very specific,” Johansson told EW at Comic-Con.  “She really is in a dark place where she’s got no one to call and nowhere to go.	-0.0234939623624086

WAPO_2ddd270fe19cac58768e1c4e71fb6ab4-2	We’ve seen female heroes taking over for male heroes before, but has it ever been a mantle this big? Thor is royalty at Marvel — within the pages of the comics and in the halls of Marvel editors.  And the key thing to remember is that it’s not just about the fanBOY demographic as it often was decades ago anymore.  Female readership is a force in the comic-book industry, compelling publishers to address issues of diversity.  Before the Internet explodes, let’s see how the new Thor does with the hammer — and how all readers respond to the books — before labeling this merely another publicity stunt.  2  .  A champion for diversity Marvel continues to take very seriously its stated promise to make its universe as diverse as its readership.  Whether changes involve the biracial Ultimate Spider-Man, a half Latino Nova, the Muslim Ms. Marvel or the all-female X-Men team, Axel Alonso meant it when he assumed the editorship several years ago and said the pages of Marvel Comics would reflect the real world — that no matter who you are, no matter where you’re from or what your religion or sexuality is, everyone deserves to feel like they can be a superhero.  3.

MARCO_09_1305693785-2	There is no doubt that Black Panther was a cultural phenomenon for black people, but these numbers show the broad appeal that a superhero movie with a largely black cast can have. But we should really give credit where credit is due… Marvel’s Marketing Department Changed The Game On Minority Movies Marvel expected black audiences to see this film, so it sought them out.  They focused trailers during NBA games, a sport that carries one of the largest black audiences.  Marvel selected rapper Kendrick Lamar to curate a soundtrack inspired by the film and had him perform the first ever halftime show at the College Football National Championship.  Most marketing teams would stop once they reached their target audience.  A minority fil would be marketed to minorities with limited efforts elsewhere.  Marvel went beyond that.  They worked with designers at New York Fashion Week to showcase a “Black Panther style”, even though diversity at the show has fallen recently.  The message was clear.  It’s okay for white people to see a movie titled Black Panther.  Is Diversity Here To Stay?  I hope this diversity is here to stay.  Disney is sending out a strong message beginning the year with Black Panther and Wrinkle in Time.	-0.0202010627835989

While the series never gained the same popularity as its (still ongoing) predecessor, Private Practice was another major show with a brief-but-meaningful role for Thompson.  Each of these performances played its part in expanding her resume and leading to her eventual fame.  Rebecca Taylor - Heroes Playing the part of Rebecca Taylor, i.e. Becky, an evolved human who can turn invisible, Tessa Thompson can be seen in three episodes in Heroes' fourth and final season.  While the actress would soon gain a great deal of fame for playing Valkyrie in the constantly-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe, it was actually in this show that Thompson got her start in the superhero genre — though her time in this once-popular series was ultimately short-lived.  While Heroes had jumped the superpowered shark at this stage and lost fans to the point of cancellation, the NBC drama was still a big deal for the rising actress.  Based on its limited viewership at the time her episodes aired, however, you'd be forgiven if you don't remember Thompson in this genre series.	-0.0149076245725154

Asking for a friend …” The question provoked ire not least because “Black Panther” marked a profound cultural moment for African Americans.  And, as many pointed out, both companies have employed Latino actors.  Rodriguez’s tweet seemed to ignore that two of Marvel’s highest-grossing movie franchises prominently feature actresses of Afro-Latino descent: Zoe Saldana, who is Dominican and Puerto Rican, stars as Gamora in “Guardians of the Galaxy”; Tessa Thompson, whose father is Afro-Panamanian, plays Valkyrie in “Thor: Ragnarok.”  Both actresses appeared in this year’s “Avengers: Endgame,” which obliterated box office records.  In 2018, Rodriguez was blasted for interrupting her “Smallfoot” co-star Yara Shahidi during a press junket when an interviewer asked Shahidi, the star of Freeform’s “Grown-ish,” about being a role model to young black women.	-0.0231063719838857

WAPO_915a66d9a547e71456a7ba16930548c3-3	Missick is convinced that the multidimensional and multicultural world that Coker, Marvel and Netflix have built with “Luke Cage” — from the hip-hop fused musical score, to multiple black and brown faces, each with their own unique role — can have a positive effect on how movie studios and television networks portray people of color. “I think that it will influence the way people look at the use of music in stories, just the way that we treat African American culture,” Missick said.  “I think the way that our writers treat the history of Harlem and the history of those people as very unique.  Hopefully it will add to the canon of work for people of color.”    Dedicated Marvel Comics fans will notice that in trailers for “Luke Cage,” Missick has yet to put on a super-suit of any sort.

WAPO_NHSQOFLA7JB5LAS5LWDWOBWILU-1	This column discusses the plot of “Captain Marvel” in general terms.   “Captain Marvel” is the “Lean In” of superhero movies, an anodyne girl-power story that treats one woman’s journey of self-discovery as a proxy for galaxy-level change.  Though the film is precisely engineered to appeal to critics like me — feminist women who came of age in the 1990s — it’s a disappointment, from the poorly shot action sequences to a shallowly written hero’s journey.  More than anything else, “Captain Marvel” is the perfect caution that giving women and people of color top billing in major franchise movies is no guarantee that those films will say anything interesting, much less daring.  In fact, the very scale at which these franchises need to appeal to audiences and the nature of their corporate entanglements suggests that these sorts of movies may be a trap for people who are eager to see not merely new faces, but new ideas of heroism, on-screen.  Our titular heroine (Brie Larson) is first introduced in 1995 as Vers, a member of the elite — literally blue-blooded — race of Kree warriors.	-0.0097518945112824

WAPO_d2ad26749ede64b1629d46777f5a0396-1	Movie studios and directors have come up with a lot of dumb excuses for not casting people of color in movies over the years.  There aren’t enough black stars who are a draw at the international box office!  Women don’t find Asian men hot!  Those people don’t try out for these kinds of roles!   There are enough obvious evasions and attempts to excuse laziness, unconscious bias or outright racism that it’s tempting to view every single explanation for why a white actor has a particular role as dishonesty.  But some of these excuses are worth listening to, not because they excuse white actors getting jobs that actors of color might have wanted to compete for, but because they tell us more about what it’s going to take to make Hollywood a more equitable place.  Take “Doctor Strange,” which has roused fans’ ire for turning the Ancient One, the titular character’s (Benedict Cumberbatch) teacher, from a Tibetan man into a Celtic woman (Tilda Swinton) who for some reason teaches in a Tibetan fortress.   Maybe Marvel just really wanted to cast Swinton — who to be fair, oozes engimatic authority — and the whole mishegas is an example of the way Hollywood seems to create opportunities for women or people of color, but not both at the same time.	-0.0112646548077464

Micheline rejected the idea that diversity could be blamed for poor sales and urged the comic-book industry to expand its audience. “I can promise you that it’s not women going into comic-book shops, sick of female characters,” Micheline wrote.  “I can similarly promise you that people of color are not entering comic-book shops and turning their noses up at faces that look like theirs.  By even making remarks like these, Marvel is seemingly conceding that its target audience, its ‘core’ audience — and their ‘core’ characters — are white and male.”  Little wonder that Marvel Studios, a Disney subsidiary that owns such lucrative franchises as “The Avengers,” “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” has been slower to reflect diverse characters on the big screen.

Are you wanting to pursue a career in technology or engineering?  If so, here are some tips to breaking into the industry and landing the job of your dreams.  1) Have relevant qualifications and experience Do you need a degree to land a tech or engineering job?  Well, according to Technology Director at reed.co.uk, Mark Ridley, the short answer is “No. Maybe.”  He goes on to say that whilst mindset, personality and capacity to learn will put you in a favourable position, education will support you in advancing your own skills and knowledge which will, of course, have a positive impact on your career.	-0.0035463795065879
560	148_1-5	What’s another tip to break into the tech industry asides from having relevant qualifications?	MARCO_19_1519183645-3	Last year, IT Directors were found to be the 9th best paid jobs in the UK, and at the rate that the technology industry is growing, this is only expected to increase. The UK Tech Salary Guide 2017 shows salaries for multiple tech roles and how much they have increased since last year, giving a deep insight into the roles that you should be looking into if money is your main motivation!  3) Show and prove your expertise Before attempting to break into the tech or engineering industry, potential employers need to be able to see that you’re a worthy candidate; having physical proof of your skills is much more powerful than relying on word of mouth alone.  Learn HTML, write a program or build a website - these all prove that you have the skills to work in tech; even if you’re a beginner, it still shows potential employers that you have the enthusiasm and willingness to learn.  Using social media platforms will also help build your personal profile; LinkedIn accounts not only show up at the top of Google when a name is searched, which will increase your visibility and credibility, it also lets you connect with industry professionals who may be looking to hire.	-0.004587601404637

MARCO_19_1519183645-4	4) Take inspiration from the professionals The key to breaking into any industry is learning about the practitioners and professionals that are currently a ‘big deal’ in their sector. This doesn’t necessarily mean becoming best friends with Kevin Lynch, the CTO of Apple (although that would be a huge bonus!), but professionals who have worked their way up in the industry, or have the job you aspire to have.  Have a look at their Twitter and LinkedIn pages to see their career paths and let that shape and influence how you go about breaking into the tech or engineering industry.  Research has shown the career paths that some of the world’s top CTO’s have taken to get to their current position, which could give you a head start if being a CTO is your dream job.  5) Sharpen up your interview skills Finally, when you’ve built up experience and knowledge about your desired industry, the final hurdle is the job interview.  The key to succeeding at interviews is proving that you have the transferable skills the company and job role requires; how will your experience benefit the business?  What is unique about you and your skills that will stand out from other applicants?  How will your personality motivate your colleagues?	-0.0033121034502983

MARCO_51_58815921-2	Grow Your Tech Network Every recruiter needs a good business network to pull candidates from, but as you begin to narrow your focus to specific industries, your network needs to get more focused as well. In order to find more technical candidates, get referrals from existing contacts in technical industries.  Ask them what conferences they are attending, then maybe attend a few yourself.  Visit local colleges that train in technical fields to find fresh talent, and look for trade organizations for technical professionals.  Take all the advice for growing your network and apply it to technical industries.  Research Your Industries Because technical positions can be, well, technical, itâ€™s important for a technical recruiter to have a thorough knowledge of the various positions they will be sourcing candidates for.  While some of this knowledge can be gained through experience, recruiters that are looking to focus in technology recruiting should learn as much as they can about the pay structures, job titles and common management structures used in these industries as quickly as possible.  To find out about these sort of things, recruiters can talk to their technical candidates as well as their clients.  Find Talent on the Web Many technical candidates network with each other using the Internet, so a recruiter who wants to source technical talent needs to go where the candidates are.	-0.0038277469575405

Be connected to the pulse of what’s happening Networking groups can give you an inside track into what’s happening in your industry and in your greater community. You can access people and information from experts who influence your field to authors speaking, or hearing what’s up in our community at Ignite Seattle.  By asking questions and understanding the trends in your industry, community and state, you’re setting yourself up for success.  3.  Be proactive.  Share your voice and opinions Want to shape the future of your industry?  Then let your voice be heard.  People who are active in their networks can have a big impact on the conversations that inform that space.  The takeaway is that if you have something worth contributing, take ownership of it and the whole community will benefit.  Another thing to consider, especially in the tech space here in the Northwest, is that change is inevitable.  Rather than being swept up in the tide, be proactive and take ownership of conversations that affect you.

However, avoid exaggerating your connections to industry players.  It will serve you far better to talk about who you read and how you stay current on the latest happenings in cyber security than to gratuitously name-drop (so avoid claiming that you’re poker buddies with Eugene Kaspersky).  According to Forbes, the key to starting a lucrative career in cyber security is to “get involved in meetups, attend conferences, ask for tips over coffee with current security professionals of local tech companies.  If these things aren’t possible, online networking is a good idea too.”  There are dozens of cyber security groups on LinkedIn, with topics ranging from general to highly specific. 7.  Don’t feel like you have to be an expert on everything The world of cyber security continues to evolve rapidly, meaning there will invariably be new technology, trends or threats with which you are not intimately familiar.  Rather than present yourself as an expert generalist with across-the-board knowledge, highlight your own skills and experiences that best connect to what you see as the needs of the organization.	-0.0064351484179496

MARCO_50_2403873835-35	I think this mostly speaks to the terrible state of wages in the United States. Now, as to why: you're mostly correct that it's due to supply and demand.  There are a lot of software engineers, but only some of them are good enough to work at a big firm like Google.  But also, there's a huge amount of money in software that there isn't in other industries.  Not only is it still new, but there's a ton of money going into the industry.  Google makes a ton of money.  VCs who got rich doing other things are pouring money randomly into assorted startups.  Another big factor is that you don't need that much manpower to operate a tech company, so you can afford to increase your salaries to attract better talent.  And finally, the culture: people who are running tech companies probably used to be engineers themselves, and thus are more sympathetic to software engineers' salary.  Honestly, I feel like the amount of students going into software isn't going to increase.  I get the feeling we're actually coming down from the peak of available software engineers at the peak of the dot com bubble.  Stan Tan , works at OwlGuru.com	-0.0282316617667675

If you want to make more money If you want to work in tech and make the most money possible, you should be applying to tech giants (think Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google).  Simply put, they offer the highest compensation in the industry.  However, for many people, working at a startup will always be preferable to working at a giant corporation.  Some people prefer the high risk, high reward potential of owning equity in a startup.  Others simply can't work in a non-startup environment.  If you'd rather take a chance at being an early employee at the next Google than being employee 85,000 at a tech giant, or if you just love startups but want to maximize your income, you need to do three things: Figure out how much pure cash you can make.  This is obvious, but you want to establish that you'll be making the most cash possible via your salary and bonuses.  Additionally, you want to make sure there is a clear path for your salary to increase as you progress in the company.	-0.0361237786710262

Spend the day researching how to create an awesome resume.  Really put a lot of hard work into making it stand out from everyone else's.  Then create a list of companies that you would love to work for.  This will be your hit-list of companies to contact over the next few days.  Then you might choose to join some job agencies who will do some of the searching for you.  The next step might be to personally deliver your resume to those companies on your hit-list: Put on some smart clothes, get yourself down there, knock on the door, introduce yourself and hand over your resume.  Literally get your foot in the door.  Those companies that you can't reach on foot, phone them up and enquire about vacancies, or email them and mail over your resume.  You get the idea here.  This is about picking yourself up off the floor and being proactive.  It is about going out there and taking action to change the course of your life.  The only person that can put a stop to this run of bad luck is YOU.  Make your plan, get yourself into bed nice and early, and wake up early and make a fresh start.	-0.0039919698610901

There are several resume formats to choose from, with the most common for beginner resumes being chronological and functional formats.  There are several template resources available that you can use once you decide which format you will follow.  2  . Begin with your contact information Contact information should be the first information listed on your resume.  You should include your full name, email, phone number and address on your beginner resume.  3. Include a resume summary or objective Following your contact information should be either your resume summary or objective.  Be sure to tailor the objective or summary to the specific position you are applying for.  4.  List your relevant work experience If using a chronological resume format, the next step will be to list any work experience you have that is relevant to the job.  This can include part-time or summer jobs, volunteer work and internships as well.  Write each position, the dates you participated in the position and either a few sentences or a bulleted list describing your duties.	-0.0043158247135579

There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	-0.0024500847794115

Author Gerald Murphy Date published February 17, 2016 Categories Analytics SEO In a recent article right here on SEW, Christopher investigated the manipulation of UK political party autosuggest queries, but what exactly is search engine bias?  Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software.  Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it.  Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	-0.0030454467050731

KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.  And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.   Search neutrality became a concern after search engines, most notably Google, were accused of search bias by other companies.  Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.   The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.  Sites like Amazon.com and Facebook are also accused of skewing results."	-0.0134418904781341

October 16, 2018 April 4, 2019 by Search Encrypt Search neutrality is the idea that a search engine does not limit or influence a person’s ability to access information on the internet.  The search engine market is very one sided with just a couple companies controlling the entire market.  “ Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider’s domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias .”  -Wikipedia  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.

Search neutrality aims to keep the organic search results (results returned because of their relevance to the search terms, as opposed to results sponsored by advertising) of a search engine free from any manipulation, while network neutrality aims to keep those who provide and govern access to the Internet from limiting the availability of resources to access any given content.   Section::::Background.   The term ""search neutrality"" in context of the internet appears as early as March 2009 in an academic paper by Andrew Odlyzko titled, ""Network Neutrality, Search Neutrality, and the Never-ending Conflict between Efficiency and Fairness in Markets""."	-0.0038197904359549
584	149_3-3	Um, what is search neutrality?	KILT_25606638-2	"In this paper, Odlykzo predicts that if net neutrality were to be accepted as a legal or regulatory principle, then the questions surrounding search neutrality would be the next controversies. Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public.  According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be ""the principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance"".  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices.  There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as ""search neutrality"" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.   In contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as ""what is search neutrality?"" or ""what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?"", appear to have less consensus.  The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality."	-0.0117379240691661

MARCO_50_1789079732-8	Others consider this help to be limiting by putting them in an “echo chamber of ideas.” If you want to avoid as much bias as possible, it’s best to choose a privacy search engine that does not track users.  If you want unbiased Google search results in privacy, you can try Startpage.com.  If you want unbiased Yahoo /Bing search results in privacy, you can try Qwant.com or DuckDuckGo.com.  These privacy search engines draw results from mainstream search engines, but deliver them without regard to user history because they don’t have that history or know who is doing the searching.

Google absolutely censors its search results, though differently depending on the laws of the country in which the search was performed.  An obvious example that is censored in all countries is child pornography.  In Germany, websites denying the Holocaust are blocked from search results.

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant.  But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble.""  This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you.  Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether.  We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience.  1.  Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode.  In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account.  This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results.

MARCO_10_988610214-8	For example, you would not get results about “school performance” or “academic functioning” because they are not worded exactly the way you searched. Use specific keyword phrases to locate the most relevant information.  For example, if you are looking for information social welfare expenditures in the U.S., you’re more likely to get the results you want by searching for “total yearly amount spent on welfare programs in U.S.” than searching for “welfare,” which would bring up definitions of welfare, types of welfare in other countries, and thousands more results you don’t want.  Be aware, though, that you can’t always find information like this -- the more words you enter, the fewer results you’re likely to get.  Use alternate words or keyword phrases to locate additional research sources.  For example, if you are researching “welfare,” consider using “safety net” or “social programs” or “public assistance” in place of “welfare” to find different results.  In many cases, your word choice might unintentionally bias your results, since terms like “welfare” are often politically loaded.  Using a wider variety of terms ensures that you’ll be exposed to a broader — and therefore potentially less biased — set of sources.	-0.0045571043156087

MARCO_53_1365652193-10	This data is a veritable gold mine to the plethora of advertisers, service providers and other parties wanting to target advertising and profile people – which means it’s in these parties’ interest to transact user data in exchange for their products. No one solution can fully protect your search data – but at the same time, there are everyday scenarios where you may want search personalization, for example, in order to find useful links again.  The most effective way to search anonymously is therefore to use a combination of the techniques above, based on your reasons for anonymity.  For example, if you’re mainly concerned about viewing less biased search results and don’t want to receive targeted advertising for a particular search term, you could open a private browsing window and search with DuckDuckGo.  You might even switch to Firefox with DuckDuckGo as your default search.  If you’re concerned about a more private way to search in general, then you might combine a VPN with a private browser window (where you are signed out of all your accounts), and search via DuckDuckGo.

It’s because those left-leaning websites are simply better at SEO.  Now there is one thing that can’t be quantified, but it could make Google results biased in some cases.  And that’s the fact that Google’s algorithm is designed and operated by humans.  Humans are inherently biased in one way or another.  You must also consider that Google uses over 10,000 humans for manually reviewing the quality of their search engine results.  It’s entirely possible that these humans could suppress pages they don’t agree with.  Bias is inevitable when humans are involved.

KILT_60912658-6	Within the context of polarizing topics such as political bias, the top search results can play a significant role in shaping opinions. Through the use of a bias quantification framework, bias can be measured within the political bias by rank, within the search system but further address the sources of the bias through the input data and ranking system.  Within the context of information queries, the search results are determined through a ranking system which in the case of topics such as Politics, can return politically biased search results.  This bias present in the search results can be a direct result of either biased data that collaborates the ranking system or because of the structure of the ranking system itself.  This questionable nature of search results raises questions of impact on users and to what degree the ranking system can impact political opinions and beliefs, which can directly translate into voter behavior.  This can also affirm or encourage biased data within the google search results.  Whilst research has shown that users do not place exclusive trust on the information provided by search engines, studies have shown that individuals that are undecided politically are susceptible to be manipulated by bias relative to political candidates and the light in which their policies and actions are presented and conveyed.	-0.0036370099987834

605	149_2-3	But how are search engines racist?	MARCO_56_1304807776-5	According to the Google insider, once it is labeled, Google’s algorithms kick in to determine where that information should appear in search results. Conservative sources are often labeled “Right Wing” by this AI process, and then pushed down in search results.  The unnamed source also says that Google is pushing its political agenda through the use of its platform.  Trump doesn’t line up with that agenda, and it is believed Google intends to stifle truth during the 2020 elections.  How It Works If Google is manipulating search results by determining what you see in the automated search suggestions, then it will be fairly easy to find out.  When you begin typing in a search term, auto fill results begin popping up in a list below where you are typing.  These have typically been placed because they are the top search terms that contain the keywords you are looking for.  This means that all users should get the same results.  However, Google has allegedly changed that algorithm by boosting searches that line up with their political agenda, and hiding those which don’t.  For instance, if we type “Hillary Clinton’s emails ” in the search bar, we get zero suggestions.	-0.0175736006349325

Yet these disparities are not necessarily evidence that the software is skewed, either.  Instead of a bias in the algorithm, they could reflect a real difference in the risk of recidivism among black defendants in this group, based on past experience.  That is, among defendants who were not arrested again, the typical black defendant might have had to overcome longer odds than the typical white defendant to stay out of jail.   The same inequities that likely explain why black defendants received worse scores in general could also account for the worse scores specifically among those who are not arrested again.	-0.0029623694717884

While the study focused on just one tool from a company called Optum, bias probably exists in tools across the private and public sectors that help manage the health care of more than 200 million Americans, researchers reported in the journal Science.  “It’s truly inconceivable to me that anyone else’s algorithm doesn’t suffer from this,” said Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of computation and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who oversaw the research.  “I’m hopeful that this causes the entire industry to say, ‘Oh, my, we’ve got to fix this.’ ”  Optum is working on a fix that could more than double the number of black patients the algorithm can identify, but it’s hard to say how many algorithms for medical care have similar issues since their inner workings are often shielded from researchers.  Some lawmakers have even introduced legislation to force companies to take accountability for such biases — intentional or not.	-0.0032843004446476
608	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly. The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found.  These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color.  For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests.  One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence.  Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms.  But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology.  Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people.  Take cannabis arrests, for just one example.  Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	-0.0033433514181524

MARCO_27_640659148-5	"They don’t have time to look through them all, so they use ATS software to do the initial sorting. This means you have to know how these algorithim-based systems work and how to get your high school resume past the digital filter.  They are designed to eliminate “unsuitable” resumes before they ever get seen by a hiring manager.  Whether an applicant's resume is perceived as a good fit is initially determined by a ""bot,"" not a person.  Employers programs the software to screen for certain skills and attributes reflected in keywords and phrases.  The ATS scans resumes on that basis, then, scores and ranks them based on how many keywords and phrases appear (as well as other factors).  Your resume will only make the cut if it is in the top ranking range.  That means it is vital for you to use those keywords in your high school resume.  Also pay special attention to formal requirements indicated in the job listing such as city, contact information, age, etc.  Now you may be wondering, how do I fit those skill keywords in with no experience?  This high school student resume example is about to show you.  Resume summary example: personality first and foremost Describing yourself can be tough, but don't hold back."	-0.0076584066264331

Resume or CV parsing is the process of converting a resume, CV or social media profile into a data structure or a set of XML or JSON tags.  As a results, resume parsing eliminates the need for manual data entry and allows applicants and companies to easily create and save meaningful data that will significantly improve candidate to job match and search results.  ALEX (Automated Linguistic EXpert), HireAbility’s CV / Resume parser and Job Order parser employs several AI strategies including natural language processing techniques and pattern recognition in order to parse relevant information from resumes written in a free-text format.  ALEX is a grammar-based parser using proprietary semantic parsing algorithms to understand and properly tag meaningful data in even the most unconventional and complicated resumes.  As a grammar-based resume parser ALEX assigns meaning to terms (words and sentences) based upon the context in which they appear.  The resume parser’s ability to properly identify the context of resume terms significantly improves the accuracy of output data compared to conventional ‘key-word’-based and statistical parsers.

The use of Applicant Tracking Systems has increased dramatically in the last few years: as shown in the image above, over 95% of large companies and over 50% of mid-sized companies use an ATS.  So what does the ATS look for in your resume?  The ATS algorithm scans for keywords that are related to the advertised job.  It also scans for information related to your work experience and education.  If the ATS determines that your resume is a good match for the position, it gives you a high ranking.  This ranking improves your chances of being seen by a recruiter and ultimately landing the interview.  Here is a popular ATS resume analyzer called Taleo, which demonstrates how an employer sees candidates for a particular job opening: As you can see, the ATS judges the candidates to the best-matched position and are given a higher ranking.  Why is it so important to optimize your resume for an ATS?  Your resume is up against a lot, so optimizing your resume for ATS scans will give you the best chance of getting noticed by an employer.  Let’s take a look at some numbers.  Here are some statistics that show what your resume is up against when you apply for a job.  (Source: Inc.com)	-0.0094974599778652

The ""Yes"" campaign advertisements were thought to be much more effective, showing their speakers listening to and answering people's concerns, while the ""No"" campaign's broadcasts featured speakers reading from an autocue.   The ""Yes"" campaign enjoyed much more funding, thanks to the support of many British businesses and the Confederation of British Industry.  According to the treasurer of the ""Yes"" campaign, Alistair McAlpine, ""The banks and big industrial companies put in very large sums of money"".  At the time, business was ""overwhelmingly pro-European"", and Harold Wilson met several prominent industrialists to elicit support.  It was common for pro-Europeans to convene across party and ideological lines with businessmen.  John Mills, the national agent of the ""No"" campaign, recalled: ""We were operating on a shoe-string compared to the Rolls Royce operation on the other side"".  However, it was also the case that many civil society groups supported the ""Yes"" campaign, including the National Farmers Union and some trade unions.   Much of the ""Yes"" campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents."	-0.0061064101755619
613	149_1-5	Yes, in what ways can search engines be biased ideologically?	KILT_58236574-1	Yes Vancouver  Yes Vancouver (stylized as YES Vancouver) is a municipal political party in Vancouver, British Columbia, created in June 2018 to support the candidacy of Hector Bremner for mayor.  The party's platform includes increasing the supply of housing, capping permit wait times, and establishing a citywide housing plan, among others proposals.   Section::::History.   Hector Bremner was first elected as an NPA councillor in the 2017 Vancouver by-election, but his bid to run for the party's mayoral nomination in the city's 2018 election was blocked by the party executive.  The president of the NPA did not reveal the reasons for rejecting Bremner's bid for nomination.  This resulted in a divide between Bremner and his supporters and the NPA leadership, prompting Bremner to split from the NPA and create Yes Vancouver on June 28, 2018.   Section::::Ideology.   The platform of Yes Vancouver is mainly focused on the city's housing shortage.  The party promises to increase the supply of rental housing in Vancouver to reduce the cost of rent by establishing citywide pre-zoning, using incentives on city-owned land to add affordable housing, and capping permit times.  The party also supports the specific targeting of speculation over the current homeowners of Vancouver.	-0.0063771088607609

MARCO_46_1211111816-1	"Hemingway: Isn't It Pretty to Think So  essays Hemingway: Isn't It Pretty to Think So 2 Pages 394 Words In Ernest Hemingway's novel, The Sun Also Rises, the quote ""'Yes,"" I said.  ""Isn't it pretty to think so.""  represents the ideological beliefs of those who were a part of America's lost generation.  The context puts the protagonist, Jake, in a position of not being able to have sex.  This, in turn, makes his possible relationship with a woman, Brett, impossible to have.  This lack of physical consummation results in the conflict invoking the quote.  Brett states that they would have had a ""damned good time together"" and Jake replies.  The interaction at hand represents the conflict between the ideological views of the lost generation and the harsh truth of reality.  Due to the war, many Americans who fought became disenchanted with America as a whole.  This resulted in a mass exodus to Europe, where many felt they could live their lives in piece.  They also felt that they could escape all the problems of life by running away from them.  The ideology is that without the war the world would have been a perfect, ideal place for them."	-0.0087575176730751
