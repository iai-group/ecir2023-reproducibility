Impacts A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.  Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.  Another example is the impact on fisheries: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on fisheries.  Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.  During the Cancún COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.  However, concrete pledges by developed countries have not been forthcoming.

But on the other hand, the people who were aware of climate change in developing nations perceived its risk to be higher than those in developed nations.  Leiserowitz adds that many people in developing nations who had never been educated about climate change said they had nonetheless already noticed local changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.  This is not necessarily surprising — time and again, scientists have warned that developing nations are likely to be hit hardest by the effects of climate change, and many climate-related changes in temperature and weather patterns are already most apparent in these places.  It’s a disproportional and, in many activists’ opinion, unjust aspect of climate change: The nations that have contributed the least amount of carbon emissions to Earth’s atmosphere are suffering the worst effects.  And the new study’s results highlight another aspect of this climate injustice — that is, people in the nations likely to be most affected by climate change are the least educated on the issue and therefore the least prepared for its effects.  “Not knowing you’re at risk makes you more vulnerable to risk,” Leiserowitz says.	82.68422979229945

9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_36_685584816-2	Here are just a few ways that climate change impacts our everyday lives: Climate Change Is Bad for Our Health Climate change impacts human health in countless ways, but four are worth emphasizing here: Rising temperatures: As temperatures climb around the globe, we expect to see more heatwaves – and ever-more intense ones at that. Extreme heat can “ overpower the human body ” and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage.  And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor.  Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality.  For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires.  Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that “ can penetrate deep into your lungs .”  Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death.  Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks.  As our climate becomes warmer, some insects will see their geographic ranges grow – bringing the Lyme disease and West Nile or Zika viruses they carry along with them to new regions.	93.84464213222964
10	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_18_2641518114-79	"Health impacts of climate change include the direct impacts of extreme events such as storms, floods, heatwaves and fires and the indirect effects of longer-term changes, such as drought, changes to the food and water supply, resource conflicts and population shifts. Increases in average temperatures mean that alterations in the geographic range and seasonality of certain infections and diseases (including vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Ross River virus and food-borne infections such as Salmonellosis) may be among the first detectable impacts of climate change on human health.  Human health is ultimately dependent on the health of the planet and its ecosystem.  The AMA believes that measures which mitigate climate change will also benefit public health.  Reducing GHGs should therefore be seen as a public health priority."""	74.63200955465436
11	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_11_94725514-2	Climate change can affect human health in two main ways: first, by changing the severity or frequency of health problems that are already affected by climate or weather factors; and second, by creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems or health threats in places or times of the year where they have not previously occurred. Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change, but some populations will be especially affected.  These groups include the poor, some communities of color, limited English-proficiency and immigrant groups, indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, people with disabilities, and people with medical conditions.  Overview The impacts of climate change include warming temperatures, changes in precipitation, increases in the frequency or intensity of some extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.  These impacts threaten our health by affecting the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the weather we experience.  The severity of these health risks will depend on the ability of public health and safety systems to address or prepare for these changing threats, as well as factors such as an individual's behavior, age, gender, and economic status.	72.83380449004471

18	132_2-1	That’s interesting. Tell me more about how climate change affects developing countries.	KILT_78449-18	"Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called ""highly climate vulnerable"") due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

21	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_25054744-3	"These countries are currently and diversely affected by various climate change problems such as super storms, storm surges, tsunamis, droughts, famine due to climate factors, food shortage as by-product of climate change, power cutting, flash floods, mud slides, desertification, heatwaves, reduction of fresh water sources, and other effects of climate change. Climate change is globally believed and scientifically proven to have incurred from the economic activities of developed and developing nations and regions such as China, the United States, and Europe.   Section::::Formation.   The CVF was founded by the Maldives government before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which sought to increase awareness of countries considered vulnerable.  Eleven governments from Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, representing the countries most vulnerable to climate change, met near the Maldives capital of Malé in November 2009.  The governments issued a declaration expressing alarm at the pace of change and damage as a result of global warming, stating that these conditions are ""an existential threat to our nations, our cultures and to our way of life"" and ""undermine the internationally-protected human rights of our people""."	85.66606989875436
22	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_4607152-11	Many developing countries prioritize economic development over addressing the issue of climate change, as they are more concerned about pre-existing problems such as poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity, availability of drinking water, indebtedness, illiteracy, unemployment, local resource conflicts, and lower technological development. On the other hand, climate change threatens to exacerbate or stall progress on fixing some of these pre-existing problems.  Advocates have thus proposed integrating climate change adaptation into poverty reduction programs.   Section::::Considerations and general recommendations.   Section::::Considerations and general recommendations.:Principles for effective policy.   Adaptive policy can occur at the global, national, or local scale, with outcomes dependent on the political will in that area.  Scheraga and Grambsch identify 9 fundamental principles to be considered when designing adaptation policy.   BULLET::::1.  The effects of climate change vary by region.   BULLET::::2.

23	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_31835841-2	Climate change and global warming have become one of the most pressing environmental concerns and the greatest global challenges in society today. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of mitigating and adapting to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods.  However, Cammack (2007) points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level.  Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in developing countries and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions.  In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that “understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it”.	77.17545539094135
24	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250272123-2	To provide predictability on climate finance, developed countries will communicate every two years on projected levels of public climate finance to be provided to developing countries. Developing countries will report on climate finance they will provide on a voluntary basis.  Regular updates send a signal for where low-carbon investments can be made, and the resources available to help the most vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Broadening the donor base The broadening of the donor pool is important, because it recognizes the fact that many developing countries are already contributing climate finance.  Countries that were considered low-income developing countries several decades ago are now in a position which allows them to contribute climate finance for less developed countries.  Countries including Vietnam and Chile have already pledged funds to the Green Climate Fund, and China has pledged $3.1 billion for South-South cooperation between developing countries.  The new Agreement makes clear that developed countries are not shirking their responsibilities for climate finance --- which is a responsibility already recognized as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Developing countries are not obligated to provide climate finance, but they are welcomed to contribute financing for climate activities without diluting the responsibilities of developed nations to provide climate finance.	84.03942359890789

Nations must participate in a “ global stocktake ” to measure collective efforts toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals as well.  Meanwhile, developed countries also have to estimate how much financial assistance they’ll allocate to developing nations to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in the frameworks of other international agreements.

Loss and damage The agreement also recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; acknowledges the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.  Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.  A new and higher goal will be set for after this period.	81.40631473995745

The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).

Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	83.07114095520228

But here is what is certain: The United States officially pulled out of the Paris climate accord, the landmark international agreement to combat global warming, on Wednesday, the day after voting ended in a tumultuous race for the White House marked by sharp disagreement over climate change.  With the move, Trump finally fulfills a campaign pledge set five years ago during his first run for president to end U.S. involvement in a climate accord he considered an unfair deal for the country.  Biden, by contrast, has promised to reenter the accord on “day one” should he take the White House.  He said he will pressure China, Brazil and other countries to cut their own emission and preserve their forests, which keep carbon our of the atmosphere.  “The U.S. leaving the Paris climate agreement demonstrates what’s at stake in this election,” said May Boeve, executive director of 350.org, an international environmental organization.

Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve.  Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.  In Katowice, negotiators sought to finalize the rules governing those requirements.  The theory was that the international system has weak compliance mechanisms — so the best hope is for countries to figure out what they can do, get started and raise their ambition over time.	97.65810402907096

So far, delegates from hundreds of countries are participating in climate summits discussing the possible measures to combat the risks of climate change globally.  One of the most significant climate summits was the 2015 COP-21 held in Paris, France to which at least representatives from 200 countries attended the summit to participate in the discussion of solving the world's problem against water scarcity.  That is a matter that is to be urgently discussed by international organizations and political diplomats.  Certain climate summits are definitely an avenue for delegates of different countries, especially the most affected ones, could come and express their concerns and for all to find a common means to resolve existing conflicts between opposing parties.  However, in order to achieve a great outcome, an agreement in a more personal level is necessary.  That includes to come into peace and agree on fair matters that could give an assured benefit and help all nations affected.  If this crisis persists to exists, a global divide will likely happen.  This issue can only be slowed down, or stopped, through advanced, strategic solutions.

The United States preferred for China and India—two wealthy, powerful nations that also contain hundreds of millions of people still in poverty—to pitch into that $100 billion target.  Yet even as those two Asian nations talked up their own investment in climate-vulnerable nations, they blanched at being compelled to join the rich world’s pledge.  The solution: So here’s something counter-intuitive.  The text commonly called the “Paris Agreement” is actually two different documents: the agreement itself, which is legally binding, and the Paris decision, which passes the agreement and sets out a number of less legally binding ways to approach and observe it.  The Paris agreement includes no new specific commitments to finance.  But item 115 of the Paris decision says that more than that $100 billion will be needed:  *  *  * How often should nations check and reassess their emission reductions?  The problem: Two different mechanisms apply here.  The first is stock-taking, when countries will announce how they’ve reduced carbon emissions.

Climate change affects the entire globe; its impacts are more pronounced in the developing world than in the developed world.  In fact, ironically, although most of the human activity that produces climate change occurs in the developed world, many of climate changes’ effects will actually be beneficial in the developed world.  In the short- and middle-term, for example, climate change will likely increase fish and agricultural yields where populations are small and shrinking and productivity is highest.  Climate change’s impacts in the developing world will be almost exclusively negative, often terribly so.  As K. Smith tartly observed in 2008: “The rich will find their world to be more expensive, inconvenient, uncomfortable, disrupted and colourless; in general, more unpleasant and unpredictable, perhaps greatly so.  The poor will die.”	87.43064186861739

Rising sea levels cost 1% of GDP to the least developed countries in 2010 – 4% in the Pacific – with 65 billion dollars annually lost from the world economy.  Another example is the impact on fisheries: approximately 40 countries are acutely vulnerable to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on fisheries.  Developing countries with large fisheries sectors are particularly affected.  During the Cancún COP16 in 2010, donor countries promised an annual $100 billion by 2020 through the Green Climate Fund for developing countries to adapt to climate change.

KILT_78449-18	"Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called ""highly climate vulnerable"") due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world’s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.

Climate change affects the entire globe; its impacts are more pronounced in the developing world than in the developed world.  In fact, ironically, although most of the human activity that produces climate change occurs in the developed world, many of climate changes’ effects will actually be beneficial in the developed world.  In the short- and middle-term, for example, climate change will likely increase fish and agricultural yields where populations are small and shrinking and productivity is highest.  Climate change’s impacts in the developing world will be almost exclusively negative, often terribly so.  As K. Smith tartly observed in 2008: “The rich will find their world to be more expensive, inconvenient, uncomfortable, disrupted and colourless; in general, more unpleasant and unpredictable, perhaps greatly so.  The poor will die.”	76.87571044196375
48	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_25054744-3	"These countries are currently and diversely affected by various climate change problems such as super storms, storm surges, tsunamis, droughts, famine due to climate factors, food shortage as by-product of climate change, power cutting, flash floods, mud slides, desertification, heatwaves, reduction of fresh water sources, and other effects of climate change. Climate change is globally believed and scientifically proven to have incurred from the economic activities of developed and developing nations and regions such as China, the United States, and Europe.   Section::::Formation.   The CVF was founded by the Maldives government before the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which sought to increase awareness of countries considered vulnerable.  Eleven governments from Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Pacific, representing the countries most vulnerable to climate change, met near the Maldives capital of Malé in November 2009.  The governments issued a declaration expressing alarm at the pace of change and damage as a result of global warming, stating that these conditions are ""an existential threat to our nations, our cultures and to our way of life"" and ""undermine the internationally-protected human rights of our people""."	85.66606989875436
49	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_4607152-11	Many developing countries prioritize economic development over addressing the issue of climate change, as they are more concerned about pre-existing problems such as poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity, availability of drinking water, indebtedness, illiteracy, unemployment, local resource conflicts, and lower technological development. On the other hand, climate change threatens to exacerbate or stall progress on fixing some of these pre-existing problems.  Advocates have thus proposed integrating climate change adaptation into poverty reduction programs.   Section::::Considerations and general recommendations.   Section::::Considerations and general recommendations.:Principles for effective policy.   Adaptive policy can occur at the global, national, or local scale, with outcomes dependent on the political will in that area.  Scheraga and Grambsch identify 9 fundamental principles to be considered when designing adaptation policy.   BULLET::::1.  The effects of climate change vary by region.   BULLET::::2.  The effects of climate change may vary across demographic groups.   BULLET::::3.  Climate change poses both risks and opportunities.   BULLET::::4.  The effects of climate change must be considered in the context of multiple stressors and factors, which may be as important to the design of adaptive responses as the sensitivity of the change.   BULLET::::5.  Adaptation comes at a cost.   BULLET::::6.  Adaptive responses vary in effectiveness, as demonstrated by current efforts to cope with climate variability.	82.2371193356812
50	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	KILT_31835841-2	Climate change and global warming have become one of the most pressing environmental concerns and the greatest global challenges in society today. As this issue continues to dominate the international agenda, researchers from different academic sectors have for long been devoting great efforts to explore effective solutions to climate change, with technologists and planners devising ways of mitigating and adapting to climate change; economists estimating the cost of climate change and the cost of tackling it; development experts exploring the impact of climate change on social services and public goods.  However, Cammack (2007) points out two problems with many of the above discussions, namely the disconnection between the proposed solutions to climate change from different disciplines; and the devoid of politics in addressing climate change at the local level.  Further, the issue of climate change is facing various other challenges, such as the problem of elite-resource capture, the resource constraints in developing countries and the conflicts that frequently result from such constraints, which have often been less concerned and stressed in suggested solutions.  In recognition of these problems, it is advocated that “understanding the political economy of climate change is vital to tackling it”.	77.17545539094135
51	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250272123-2	To provide predictability on climate finance, developed countries will communicate every two years on projected levels of public climate finance to be provided to developing countries. Developing countries will report on climate finance they will provide on a voluntary basis.  Regular updates send a signal for where low-carbon investments can be made, and the resources available to help the most vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Broadening the donor base The broadening of the donor pool is important, because it recognizes the fact that many developing countries are already contributing climate finance.  Countries that were considered low-income developing countries several decades ago are now in a position which allows them to contribute climate finance for less developed countries.  Countries including Vietnam and Chile have already pledged funds to the Green Climate Fund, and China has pledged $3.1 billion for South-South cooperation between developing countries.  The new Agreement makes clear that developed countries are not shirking their responsibilities for climate finance --- which is a responsibility already recognized as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Developing countries are not obligated to provide climate finance, but they are welcomed to contribute financing for climate activities without diluting the responsibilities of developed nations to provide climate finance.	84.03942359890789

Loss and damage The agreement also recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; acknowledges the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.  Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.

MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).

Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	83.07114095520228

But here is what is certain: The United States officially pulled out of the Paris climate accord, the landmark international agreement to combat global warming, on Wednesday, the day after voting ended in a tumultuous race for the White House marked by sharp disagreement over climate change.  With the move, Trump finally fulfills a campaign pledge set five years ago during his first run for president to end U.S. involvement in a climate accord he considered an unfair deal for the country.  Biden, by contrast, has promised to reenter the accord on “day one” should he take the White House.

The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit.  Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday.  Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.”  Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  He also announced that Britain will ban new gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035, cutting the current target of 2040 by five years.  Other countries, such as Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, are banning fossil fuel vehicles by 2030.  Britain’s car industry questioned whether the goal is achievable."	88.12434927175536

Following Trump's announcement, the governors of several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to continue to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal.  As of April 29, 2019, 23 states and Puerto Rico have joined the alliance, and similar commitments have also been expressed by other state governors, mayors, and businesses.   Section::::Background.   The Paris Agreement was an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year, including the United States then under the presidency of Barack Obama.  Due to the status of the United States and China as the greatest emitters of carbon dioxide, Obama's support and his cooperation with China were seen as major factors leading to the convention's early success.	76.04830269888043

Opposition is 15 percentage points higher among Americans under age 40 than among seniors ages 65 and older (67 percent vs. 52 percent), and non-white adults are similarly more likely to oppose exiting the climate deal than whites (71 percent vs. 54 percent).  One cleavage of support bodes well for Trump and Republicans: Registered voters are twice as likely to approve of Trump’s decision to exit the climate agreement (33 percent vs. 15 percent).

WAPO_f19811041b70ef52f08371f494a50ec0-1	President Trump’s announcement Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement unleashed a backlash on Twitter.  Elon Musk said he would leave the president’s advisory council, while politicians and pundits framed the move as reckless by highlighting the two other countries whose leadership refused to sign the accord: Syria and Nicaragua.  The message was clear: The United States — once a world leader that sat at the front of the class — has relegated itself to the back of the room with the world’s perceived outliers.  Some commenters noted that even Uzbekistan, a onetime Paris holdout that is home to one of the worst ecological disasters on the planet, signed the climate agreement last month.  The problem with the comparison, and the implicit developed-world condescension it contains, is the glaring absence of context.  Syria didn’t sign the agreement because the country remains locked in a protracted civil war that the United Nations estimates may have displaced 12 million people and resulted in more than 250,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, Nicaraguan leaders said they declined to enter the Paris agreement not because they didn’t want to abide by new emissions standards but because those standards weren’t strict enough and didn’t require enough sacrifice from wealthier countries with larger economies, according to Reuters.	74.07915126159787

The United States, in this scenario, would have to go from lowering its emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 (its current goal), to cutting them by 45 percent by 2030.  Other nations would have to make similarly large improvements on what they are currently promising to do.  And even then, due to scientific uncertainty, the planet could still conceivably overshoot 2 degrees, and there is only a 66 percent or greater chance of getting there.  Of course, the actual embraced goal of the world is to stay “well below” 2 degrees, a target that suggests prudent avoidance, not walking right up to it and potentially going over.  Accordingly, the study also examined what it would take to suppress emissions fast enough to hit 1.5 degrees C. Here we’d have to have global emissions peak in 2020 and then decline by 5.9 percent annually thereafter.  The United States, here, would have to get its emissions 60 percent below their 2005 levels by 2030.  This is extreme, but then, that’s what it would take.  If we want to buy time, we have to save forests.   There’s some good news here.	77.87127968296409
71	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_9b671b670858ecbdcbed88126425856d-4	Many factors will play a role, such as the shares of natural gas and coal in the electricity sector, as well as energy efficiency investments that drive down demand. However, we estimate that the U.S. can achieve the majority share of its original 2025 emissions reduction target even with federal policy changes.  More ambitious state policies would further compensate for changes at the federal level.  On the basis of these numbers alone, it’s clear that the United States will continue to contribute to clean energy market expansion and emissions reduction even with changes to federal policy.  Additionally, several states are well positioned to increase their clean energy ambition to keep the U.S. mostly on track to meeting its near-term clean energy commitments, and to keep longer-term emissions goals – not yet implemented in policy – within reach.  Moreover, many countries are likely to stick to their climate plans.  China, which represents more than one third of the expected solar PV and wind capacity growth between now and 2030, has indicated it plans to do so.  The EU commitment looks strong as well.  The demand created in China, the EU, and India – together accounting for over 50 percent of global solar PV and wind capacity additions by 2030 – argues for companies to stay competitive in these markets.	73.6881566918455

81	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor. It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks.  STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48.  Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7.  Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10.  Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22.  Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes.  These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48.  Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection.  Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	93.90952066440876
82	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1385660336-6	Moisturizing Gentle on sensitive skin Applied with fingers Can feel sticky at first Natural Natural deodorants use baking soda, salt crystals, or essential oils to combat sweat and odor. All-natural products No aluminum salts, parabens, or other chemicals Come in stick, spray, cream, and solid “crystal” forms Scented or unscented Not necessarily hypoallergenic (Essential oils can cause itching, irritation, or skin rashes.)  Did you know?  Most deodorants have fragrance, so choose one that complements your perfume or just smells nice.  Also check any reactions to your skin before you buy one.  STAFF BestReviews Women’s deodorant prices There are deodorants for women that cost from $5 to $20 and more, but there’s no reason to spend more than a few dollars.  While you can certainly spend more – there are designer, specialty, and natural products that cost more than $20 – most women can find an effective deodorant at the drugstore that costs about $5.  Tips Cover your entire underarm area.  Many women just swipe the deodorant up and down a couple of times without coming in contact all of the skin in their armpits.  Apply deodorant at bedtime.	85.85087771179678
83	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_45_622525419-2	Keep in mind that even all-natural or organic deodorants include ingredients that can harm you when absorbed into your bloodstream. Also, follow the directions on the deodorant.  Crystal stone deodorants, for example, require that you wet the stone before applying it as a deodorant.  Where to Buy Some deodorants, including the Dr. Hauschka and Weleda brands, are available only online or through high-end retailers.  Burt’s Bees and Arm & Hammer both make natural, aluminum-free deodorants that are sold in grocery stores, discount stores, drugstores and pharmacies.  Some products are also available from beauty supply stores.  If you decide to shop online, look for stores that offer free or discount shipping.  Cost While some aluminum-free deodorants cost up to $30, others are available for $5 or less.  The Weleda and Dr. Hauschka products are at the higher end of the spectrum, retailing for around $25 as of 2010.  Crystal Stone deodorants are a mid-priced option, retailing for around $10 to $15.  The company behind the Crystal Stone deodorant also makes a smaller and cheaper travel size, so you can test the product before committing to one of the larger sizes.	85.75510005014075

Plus I just love being able to pick and choose my favorite goodies to include.  Since this gift basket is for Mother’s Day, I went with the theme of “pampering” and selected just a few of my favorite at-home pampering and beauty products to give.  I especially love the eos line of lip balms and lotions, and I wanted to make sure to include a few items from their Limited Edition Spring Packs in my basket.  To round out the basket, I included a few other pampering products in coordinating, brightly colored packaging.  Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links.

You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.  Essential oils are extracted from plants and can be less potentially irritating or allergenic.	90.55077488988172
97	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_58_683154701-9	"There’s no need to pay extra for scented body lotions. Instead, choose an unscented lotion, then add 3-4 drops of undiluted lavender oil to the bottle.  If you don’t want the whole bottle of lotion to smell like lavender, dispense a little lotion into your hands, add 1 drop of lavender oil, and rub your hands together to mix it thoroughly.  {""smallUrl"":""https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/8\/8d\/Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg\/v4-460px-Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\/images\/thumb\/8\/8d\/Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg\/aid6902816-v4-728px-Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":345,""bigWidth"":728,""bigHeight"":546,""licensing"":""<div class=\""mw-parser-output\""><p>License: <a target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""nofollow noreferrer noopener\"" class=\""external text\"" href=\""https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\"">Creative Commons<\/a><br>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><\/div>""} 2 Make a sugar scrub with sugar, undiluted lavender, and oil.  Mix 1.5 cups (350 mL) of granulated sugar, 0.25 cups (59 mL) of your favorite carrier oil, and 5-8 drops of lavender oil to create a sugar scrub that will leave your skin feeling soft and smooth.  If you like, you can add 3 drops of purple food coloring, but this is optional."	90.16712751987508
98	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_47_521703086-2	You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries. Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.  Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container.  Enjoy your new scented body lotion.  Warnings Choose a good quality lotion to avoid problems with separation and spoilage.	87.7745188283152
99	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_15_1872813287-3	So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils. Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin.  So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion.  But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion.  Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils.  Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well.  So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc.  Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.	81.378971837461
100	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_58_105794544-8	You can use a single essential oil or a combination of several—it's completely customizable. If you aren’t sure what scents you like, you might try: Lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent Rose oil for a classic floral fragrance Citrus oils like sweet orange and grapefruit for a bright, energetic scent Patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent Myrrh, frankincense, or benzoin for a dramatic, resinous scent Tip: Always use high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oil for your lotion.  Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin.  2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil.  At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance.  If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again.  However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil.  Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted.  3 Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color.  These products are oil-soluble, so they're perfect for this recipe.	80.6307214666158
101	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_24_1169299216-5	The type of essential oils you use will depend on the purpose of the lotion: Peppermint and ginger for cooling massage lotions after exercise. Calendula and chamomile for sensitive skin.  Argan oil and patchouli for anti-aging face creams.  Aqueous vs. Oil Lotions The main difference between a lotion and body butter is how much water is in it.  With most creams, more than half of the tub is water.  When you’re making home-made lotions, the problem with water is that it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold.  This means that to keep the lotion fresh, you need to add some sort of preservative.  Some essential oils, such as tea tree, make good preservatives, so if you are planning on adding those to your blend, then that may be enough to preserve a small tub of lotion.  If you don’t want to add preservatives, though, you’re going to struggle.  Body butter is less likely to go rancid quickly, but a lot of people don’t like them because of the texture.  Water-based oils are a good choice for those people, and there are some active ingredients such as rose water, aloe juice, and witch hazel that are water soluble and work well in water-based lotions.	76.76053467392921
102	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_23_881727735-2	Formulation: 90% Cyclomethicone 5% Artisan’s Perfume Base 5% fragrance oil Step 1 Using the Funnel Pitcher and scale, weigh out 8 ounces of Cyclomethicone. Step 2 Measure by weight .40 ounce of body safe Fragrance Oil and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  We used Light Blue type fragrance oil in this recipe.  Usage is 5% of fragrance oil to the Cyclomethicone.  In this tutorial, 5% of 8 ounces is .40 ounces.  Step 3 Add 5% of the Artisan’s Perfume Base.  Weigh out .40 ounce of the Artisan’s Perfume Base and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  The Artisan’s Perfume Base will add a cooling effect to the spray.  Step 4 Stir slowly until fully incorporated.  Cyclomethicone stays completely blended and crystal clear without the need for shaking.  Step 5 Slowly pour the product into 2-ounce Tapered PET Spray bottles.  This tutorial will make four 2-ounce bottles of Dry Oil Spray.  Step 6 Mix and match fragrance oils to come up with a unique scent.  Enjoy!  DIY Crafting Tutorials - spread the love!

103	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_52_1346111477-7	Do not use a stick blender to mix in the fragrance, or the batter may become too thick. Crisp Cotton Fragrance Oil does not accelerate trace in cold process soap.  If you are working with a different fragrance oil that does accelerate trace, add the fragrance oil after adding the colorants.  FIVE:  Split the soap batter into two even containers; it’s okay to eyeball it!  There will be about 3 cups in each container.  SIX: To one container, add all the dispersed Ultramarine Blue Oxide and use a whisk to mix in.  To the other container, add all the dispersed Titanium Dioxide and use a whisk to thoroughly mix in.  SEVEN: Pour about 1/4 of the white soap into the mold.  Tap the mold on the counter gently to release any bubbles.  EIGHT: Pour about 1/4 of the blue soap into the layer of white, moving the soap throughout the mold.  Pour from a few inches above the mold to cause the soap to “break through” into the white.  Don’t worry about making your pour “perfect.”  NINE: Continue to pour the white and blue soap into the mold from various heights.  As you continue to pour, the soap will begin to swirl itself naturally.	83.55624904359138
104	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_55_59440734-5	With the introduction of stick blenders to soap making, the trace can be reached in a few minutes. The Spruce / David Fisher Add Fragrance or Essential Oils After the soap mixture is completely blended, but before it gets too thick, slowly add any fragrance or essential oils from your recipe to the mixture.  Stop stick blending the mixture and just use the end of the stick blender like a spoon.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Additives or Extras If your recipe calls for additives such as spices, natural exfoliants, flower petals, herbs, or special moisturizing oils, now is the time to add them.  As you did with the fragrance, gently stir them into the pot using the stick blender as a spoon.  Before you move on to adding the colorant, give the mixture a brief blend with the stick blender to make sure that the fragrance oil and additives are well mixed.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Color to the Soap Next, add color to the soap.  If you want the soap to be one single color, add the colorant to the pot and stir.  If you want to achieve a swirl effect, do the following: Ladle about 1/2 to 1 cup of the soap mixture into a measuring cup.  Add the colorant to that bit of soap.	82.10163335261313

112	133_2-1	Can you tell me how to make a body scrub at home?	MARCO_34_552141024-6	Step 1: Prep Fabric To make the DIY makeup remover pads, you'll need half a yard each of double gauze fabric and an organic bamboo terry fabric. Prewash and dry both fabrics, then lay the fabrics down with right sides together.  Cut the fabric into 4-inch squares.  You'll need one square of each fabric for each makeup remover pad you want to make: We suggest making one for each day of the week, so you only have to wash them once a week.  Step 2: Sew Fabric Squares Once you've cut the fabric squares, place one gauze square on top of a terry square with right sides together and clip or pin the fabric in place.  Use a ¼-inch seam allowance to sew around all four edges, leaving a one-inch opening on one side.  Clip the corners and turn the pad right side out.  Repeat this step for each pad you want to make.  Step 3: Finish Sewing Pads Once you've sewn and turned each pad right side out, fold in the edges of the one-inch opening and iron to flatten the seams.  Then topstitch with a 1/8-inch seam allowance around all four edges of the pad, which will close the gap you left earlier.	84.86950066802092

Once you’ve grabbed your wipe, immediately replace the lid of your jar (or zip up your bag).  Unfold your wipe.  Gently glide it over your skin, taking care not to tug around the delicate eye area.  Once you’re finished removing your makeup, you can rinse your face with water to remove any residue, if desired.  But a second cleanser is not necessary, as these wipes cleanse while they remove makeup.  Proceed with the rest of your skincare routine as usual.  Remember that these wipes aren’t just for makeup.  They’re just as useful for a gentle morning cleanse or to refresh your skin after a workout.  And if you need to touch up any makeup mistakes, they work well for this, too.

While the color remover works well, it doesn’t smell very good, and it does significantly dry out the hair.  • The second option is nearly as effective as using a color remover, but it is much gentler on the hair and it doesn’t involve any bleach.  The added bonus is that it’s a fun DIY recipe!  All it’ll require is your clarifying shampoo of choice and some vitamin C powder.  You can either buy vitamin C powder as is, or buy vitamin C pills that can be crushed into a powder.  In a bowl, mix together a spoonful of vitamin C powder with an equal amount of clarifying shampoo – you want to make enough so that you can cover all of your hair, so make more if your hair is long.  Apply this mixture to your hair while it is damp, making sure to thoroughly cover every strand.  Once your whole head is covered, put on a shower cap, and let it sit on your head for an hour.  Once the time elapses, rinse it out in the shower.	86.67471279279562
117	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_45_1019718891-25	That doesn’t necessarily mean that iOS phones perform truly better than Android phones—though they often do—it just means that iOS is better at working with the hardware to create a great user experience. There’s also the fact that iPhones work better with other Apple devices.  Safe to say, if you have a Mac computer or iPad, then an iPhone may be the way to go, as it makes it easy to sync things like photos, messages, e-mails, and more, all with Apple’s iCloud.  If you want a simple user interface, better Apple integration, and a phone that performs better for longer, then a phone with iOS is probably the way to go.  Other Features and Considerations The operating system isn’t the only thing to consider when buying a smartphone, though if you’ve figured out which operating system you want, then you’ve done a lot of the work.  You’ll also want to think about the hardware (processor, RAM, etc.) under the hood, the camera, screen size, battery capacity, and more.  Only a few of these things are an issue when buying an iPhone (there are only a few iPhone models each year to choose from).	86.28198629501276

Things to Consider When Shopping for an iPhone While there's no single rule about what makes one store better than another for buying an iPhone, some factors that might make a store the best place for you to buy an iPhone include: Promotions: Because everyone sells the same iPhone for basically the same price, retailers sometimes offer bonus promotions to get you to choose them.  You could snag a free case, gift card, or another incentive if you keep an eye out for deals.  Existing Relationship: Sometimes, the best place to buy an iPhone is the easiest — and that may be from your current phone company.  Buying a new phone from your current company makes for a smooth transition.  Trade-In Value: Some retailers will offer a trade-in credit for your old phone to discount the price of the new one.  The more trade-in cash you get, the better a deal may be.  Justin Sullivan/Staff/Getty Images News Should I Wait for a Sale to Buy an iPhone?  Nope.  That's because the iPhone almost never goes on sale.	82.4232673693914

MARCO_28_545748290-1	"What Are the Advantages of Using an iPhone?  | Small Business - Chron.com What Are the Advantages of Using an iPhone?  Small Business | Business Communications & Etiquette | Presentations By Scott Cornell Due to increased competition, Apple's iPhone is less synonymous with the term ""smartphone"" than it was in earlier years.  While the iPhone is being challenged by other brands, such as Android and Samsung, it's still the go-to phone for many users.  The iPhone offers a sleek design, is user friendly, features fast browsing speeds and is currently available from all the major U.S. cell service providers.  There are several other features and advantages that make iPhone a must-have among users.  FaceTime One big benefit exclusive to the iPhone and other Apple devices is the FaceTime feature, which uses the phone's front-facing camera to enable video chats with other iPhone users in high definition.  Previously only available to be used over Wi-Fi connections, you can now make FaceTime video calls over cellular data with the iPhone 5.  FaceTime is a personal way to stay in touch with family, friends and clients when geography presents a challenge.  Camera The iPhone camera is so advanced that many people are doing away with their digital cameras and using their iPhone exclusively for picture-taking purposes."	96.64687189297548

MARCO_43_1536748853-2	The Apple Watch app is not available on iPod touch or iPad devices, and it cannot pair with Android devices at all either. Am I better off with an iPhone?  If you have an Apple Watch and plan on using it, then yes, because an iPhone is required to get it set up, even if you have the cellular version.  There are also plenty of other benefits of using an iPhone over an iPod touch.  The iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch Super Retina HD OLED Display (XS Max has 6.5-inches of screen), which is much more vibrant and has a higher resolution than the 4-inch Retina display of the iPod touch 7.  There are also better cameras (dual 12MP versus 8MP for rear, 7MP versus 1.2MP for front) with Portrait Mode and Lighting.  The iPhone XR even has a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, which is also better than the iPod touch 7.  Plus, with an iPhone, you'll be able to stay connected wherever you are due to a cellular data plan, versus the iPod touch that can only connect via Wi-Fi.	85.70727865802473

MARCO_10_1605844582-4	For smaller companies that don't want to invest in the IT infrastructure for an Exchange server, for example, or for larger companies with unsupported BYOD programs, iCloud makes it easy for corporate iPhone users to keep their data safe. iCloud has the added benefit of allowing customers to remotely lock, locate, or erase their phones if they are lost or stolen; the automatic backup function allows users to be back up and running very quickly once they get a new phone.  The usefulness of this feature cannot be underestimated, as anyone who has ever lost a phone and then spent hours rebuilding their digital life will tell you.  Then there's the App Store, which includes a huge variety of the high-quality mobile apps.  Competitors in the mobile market Traditionally, Apple competed with other PC manufacturers such as Dell or HP.  But these days, since those companies don't really compete in the mobile space (instead selling lower-cost PCs or data center equipment that Apple doesn't offer), Apple's competition has changed significantly.  Apple is competing with Google and Amazon on services, including app, music, and book stores.  Google and Microsoft make competing smartphone and tablet operating systems.  Microsoft and Samsung are Apple's biggest competition in mobile hardware.	81.70213357685134

Dear Lifehacker, You guys write a lot about Android and iOS, but what about Windows Phone?  I'm in… Read more The nice thing about the Windows Phone is that it's a really good mix of the better features of the iPhone and Android.  It has the ease of use of the iPhone where anyone can pick it up and use it, but Windows Phones also have a bunch of model options like Android, so they can find a bigger screen or nice hardware if they want.

MARCO_06_1823564873-6	First: Windows Phone is the best operating system for a smartphone newbie, someone who wants a simple smartphone that is easy to use and that can make calls, check email and surf the Internet. This person doesn’t download a lot of apps or need to customize his or her phone or unlock it or anything: He or she just wants the basics of the smartphone in a beautiful, simple package.  That’s the meat-and-potatoes Windows Phone market, the shoppers who should most seriously be looking at Windows Phones.  Others who should be looking at Windows Phone include those with Hotmail accounts and those who do lots of work with Microsoft software.  Those who value strong, clean design and hipness in their gadgets might also consider Windows Phone.  It’s still difficult, however, for me to recommend Windows Phone over Android or iOS.  This might change in a year, but right now the iPhone and especially Android just offer a far more robust, complete set of features and applications for buyers.  Windows Phone — despite its splendid aesthetics and smooth operation — feels about a year away from being truly on level with Android and iPhone for a heavy smartphone user.	87.17557258391753

Windows phone failed for different reasons.  I looked at android phones a couple years ago.  It sucked.  I only saw a cluttered screen with every possible color in the world jammed in the home screen.  I used briefly a couple android tablets.  Felt like junk.  IPhone I used superficially.  Interface was better than android.  This article’s first reason is choices, choices and choices.  And that reason itself killed android from my list.  Who said too many choices is a good thing.  Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision.  A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me.  IPhone did that.  People don’t grow fans out of thin air.  There has to be stuff backing it.  Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years.  Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized.  So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones.  Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.  I am yet to test both phones but I am leaning towards IPhone.	83.52426825091243

Alright, alright, calm yourselves, keyboard warriors, we know this is something most of you would probably not agree with because let’s face it, with over 80 percent of smartphone market share in the world, the Android mobile operating system leads the rest of the competition by a mile.  Perhaps because it is the OS adopted by many leading brands of smartphones, fragmentation becomes an issue that plagues Android-powered phone.  Here is a post by Azzief Khaliq that argues for and against the effects of Android OS fragmentation you should check out.  Here, the Windows Phone’s fast and user-friendly OS plus its integration with Microsoft-linked products has given many users, particularly who work a lot with Windows products, a reason to consider the integrated mobile platform.  On the surface, it offers the same functionality (and perhaps a bit more) as do other platforms but these are 10 features that you may find better on a Windows Phone than on an Android.  1.

MARCO_58_920132313-2	"Now, with established platforms, popular devices and user's forced exodus from Windows-on-phone Microsoft isn't making another smartphone, even if you want one. But Microsoft isn't done with mobile.  What makes a mobile platform successful?  Nadella was probably right in his early assessment that there was no room for a third mobile platform in the traditional slate smartphone sense.  Nadella made later statements about bringing an ""ultimate mobile device to market,"" that is ""beyond the curve.""  This lends credence to the belief that his reservations about a third mobile platform were limited to refraining from competing in a market with entrenched rivals, invested users, an app store and developer economy that had passed slow-moving Microsoft by.  The current 11-year-old mobile infrastructure revolves around app ecosystems, strong developer and carrier relationships, OEM partnerships in the case of Google and Android, and premium hardware and software synergy for Apple.  From 2010 to 2015 Microsoft tried (perhaps half-heartedly) to adapt its mobile efforts to this infrastructure but failed miserably.  Microsoft ultimately realized there was no room for another smartphone platform.  And that's okay; smartphones are dead anyway.

MARCO_43_1625245214-4	"Another thing that I've done that has been really helpful for time management is using an app called Focus Time. I do a 20- to 35-minute sprint timed with Focus Time in the morning before the kids are even up.  When I get back from that, I pick the biggest work task of the day that I want to get accomplished, and get to it.  The most important aspects of life for me are health and family, so I focus on getting those managed well because when that is done, everything else naturally falls into place.  You have to decide what aspects of life and business are most important to you, get them running smoothly and allow your forward movement to fall into place.  5.  Approach every day as a school day.

He describes the physical aspects of writing as unhealthy or bad for his body or a ""toxin"".  Part of his reason for running is to prolong his writing life, by expelling this toxin.  Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.  I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being.  ""When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody.  All I need to do is gaze at the scenery passing by...I just run.  I run in a void.  Or maybe I should put it another way: I run in order to acquire a void...  ""I probably shouldn't be looking up at [  clouds].  What I should be looking at is inside me."	84.37391607250902

Whether its first thing in the morning (my preference), or after work (great for stress relief), sticking to a routine makes it easier to follow through with your activity every day.  The last thing you want is to run out of time and willpower on a given day, and end up skipping a day.  Knowing exactly what you want will help you get it.  4.  Keep a Daily Log Whether it’s a calendar or large notebook, take the time to jot down how far you ran each day and how your run went.  Write what you want to improve tomorrow.  Evaluating your run and making plans for future runs will grow your excitement to get out again tomorrow.  The simple act of crossing off each day on a calendar after you complete your 3 miles is shown to build the habit and make it more likely you’ll stick to your routine.  5.

One of the most popular smartphones is Apple’s iPhone.  In the U.S., roughly 45% of all smartphone owners own iPhones.  Some people enjoy having the latest iPhone, regardless of expense.

The only requirements are that the phone should be unlocked, not specific to a particular carrier, and it should be compatible with GSM Networks.  Alternatively, you can sign up for free government phones and request a SIM Card from consumer cellular.  Where to buy consumer cellular phones Most consumer cellular cell phone devices can be purchased online through your phone.  Online platforms like consumer cellular and Best Buy offer unbelievable offers on such phones.  If you need to, go into a nearby store, and physically scrutinize and sample some of the phones on display.  Additionally, you could check the discounts and offers.  Then, in this case, I would recommend Amazon, AAA, Sears, and Target stores to name a few of them.  Once you’ve purchased the smartphone, you need to sign up for a plan.  After signing up, buying a plan on their website is pretty straightforward.  Just select the “Plans” tab and the options will be available for you to choose.  The least you can pay for the plan is $15 plus an additional $5 for data and unlimited minutes.	87.84415821870789

MARCO_22_1749042451-6	Motorola Moto G7 Power If you want something more affordable, cheaper, but has the latest in Android and that comes with 5000mAh of battery, then the Motorola Moto G7 Power is an excellent phone to consider. With an ANSI rating of M4/T3, not only that you’ll get the latest in Android, but you’ll also get a phone that has better HAC ratings than Google’s flagship phone and all of that for less than USD$300 SRP.  So if you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t break the bank, something of the latest but not necessarily the best, then we highly recommend considering the Moto G7 Power.  5.  Samsung Galaxy A10e If you want an Android smartphone that’s cheaper, more affordable, and you still find the Moto G7 Power a bit off your budget, then we highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy A10e.  This phone has an ANSI rating of M3/T3 with an SRP of USD $179.99.  In some countries, it is being sold for under 100 which is by far the cheapest Samsung phone with the latest Android OS to date.  So if you’re someone who’s new to the smartphone, or planning to gift this device to your parents or elderly relatives, then the Galaxy A10e is a great option to consider.	97.59293666721896
151	134_1-7	How much cheaper is the Samsung Galaxy A10e than the Motorola Moto G7 Power?	MARCO_49_1558483165-5	In terms of the front camera, the G8 Power has a 16-megapixel sensor, while the G7 Power has an 8-megapixel sensor. Price squirrel_widget_147020 The Motorola Moto G8 Power is priced at £219.99, which is a little more expensive than the G7 Power started at - £179.  You can now get the G7 Power for around the £130 mark however, making it a very tempting device despite its successor.  Conclusion The Motorola Moto G8 Power makes numerous improvements over its predecessor including a better processor, more RAM, double the storage, a bigger and sharper display, a lot more camera capabilities and a more refined design.  It pretty much improves in every area except the already excellent battery life of the G7 Power, and the software experience will be pretty much identical too.  Should you upgrade from the G7 Power?  There are definitely enough improvements to warrant the upgrade on paper.  If you're choosing between the G7 Power and the G8 Power then the G8 Power is certainly the winner in terms of specs, but the G7 Power can be found for nearly £100 cheaper now so that decision really comes down to what features are important to you and what budget you have.  If it's battery life and battery life only, the G7 Power should still be considered.	92.00313373494372

For the extra £30, the G7 Plus makes sense over the G7 on paper.  The Moto G7 Power meanwhile, appears to be a good middle device, making more sense than the G7 Play for the extra £30.  You get double the RAM and storage compared to the Play, along with almost double the battery, a larger display and a fast charger and cover in the box.  The Power is £90 cheaper than the Moto G7 Plus and while you still gain in battery life, you lose out on screen resolution, speed, a water repellent coating and camera features and capabilities.	90.27043804845924

156	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_76429195-3	The Moto G7 has a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the affordable sticker price. A 6.2-inch Full HD+ display ensures all of your apps, games, and more look sharp and colorful, and the dual 12MP + 5MP rear camera combo takes pretty good photos all things considered.  You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10.  Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app).  And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers.  We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.  Pros: Build quality is great Large and colorful display Cameras are pretty decent Works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Alexa access is hands-free Cons: Doesn't have NFC Best Alternative Moto G7 Don't like the OnePlus 8?	79.0991842141375
157	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_78846660-10	The Moto G7 is equipped with 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 512GB), has a relatively snappy Snapdragon 632 processor, and a modest 3,000 mAh battery that should get you through a full day of normal use. Just like the G7 Power, the G7 also has the excellent Moto Display for quickly seeing notifications without turning on the entire screen, as well as Moto Actions for doing things like chopping the phone to turn on the flashlight or twisting it for opening the camera.  Software updates are also a concern here just like they are with the G7 Power, but we'd expect to see an Android 10 update here before it arrives on the Power sibling.  Pros: Glass design is really sleek Large, sharp display Dual rear cameras Storage is expandable up to 512GB Moto Display and Moto Actions are excellent Cons: Motorola's track record for software updates Performance is fine Best Mid-Ranger Moto G7 The best mid-range phone for TracFone.  The Moto G7 is an incredibly solid mid-range phone.  Its display, cameras, performance, and more are all pretty good for the money.	78.11014332342893
158	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_58_970080198-4	On the inside, every version of the Moto G7 has a moderate Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor and runs on a straight-laced version of Android 9 Pie operating system, the latest and greatest from Google. There are some differences beyond that, so I’ll lay them out here.  Motorola Moto G7 ($300): It has the best screen of the bunch (described above), comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM, 64 GB of storage for apps and photos, and a dual 12- and 5-megapixel camera setup on the back.  It has a 3,000-mAh battery that typically had 20–30 percent left in the tank at the end of a day.  Performance-wise, it's a cut above the other G7s.  Moto G7 Power ($250): It has 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, a 6.2-inch 720p display with a larger notch.  The screen looks a little pixely in games and when taking photos, and it has a single 12-megapixel camera on the back.  Its claim to fame is a ginormous 5,000-mAh battery that makes the phone a millimeter fatter (honestly, not that bad) and gives it enough battery that I usually end the day with 65+ percent left.  This battery can last for days.	69.91089253034443
159	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-4	Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone. Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7.  For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.  The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	95.6874421536486
160	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-6	Pictures are sharper, so you can see finer details in things like leaves and bricks. In low light, the A50 brightens and punches up colors, while photos taken with the G7 are muddier with much hazier and washed out colors.  The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7.  I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.  The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame.  This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

161	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen. Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	92.96278632074971
162	134_1-1	What should I consider when buying a phone?	MARCO_45_1019718891-25	That doesn’t necessarily mean that iOS phones perform truly better than Android phones—though they often do—it just means that iOS is better at working with the hardware to create a great user experience. There’s also the fact that iPhones work better with other Apple devices.  Safe to say, if you have a Mac computer or iPad, then an iPhone may be the way to go, as it makes it easy to sync things like photos, messages, e-mails, and more, all with Apple’s iCloud.  If you want a simple user interface, better Apple integration, and a phone that performs better for longer, then a phone with iOS is probably the way to go.  Other Features and Considerations The operating system isn’t the only thing to consider when buying a smartphone, though if you’ve figured out which operating system you want, then you’ve done a lot of the work.  You’ll also want to think about the hardware (processor, RAM, etc.) under the hood, the camera, screen size, battery capacity, and more.  Only a few of these things are an issue when buying an iPhone (there are only a few iPhone models each year to choose from).	86.28198629501276

Things to Consider When Shopping for an iPhone While there's no single rule about what makes one store better than another for buying an iPhone, some factors that might make a store the best place for you to buy an iPhone include: Promotions: Because everyone sells the same iPhone for basically the same price, retailers sometimes offer bonus promotions to get you to choose them.  You could snag a free case, gift card, or another incentive if you keep an eye out for deals.  Existing Relationship: Sometimes, the best place to buy an iPhone is the easiest — and that may be from your current phone company.  Buying a new phone from your current company makes for a smooth transition.  Trade-In Value: Some retailers will offer a trade-in credit for your old phone to discount the price of the new one.  The more trade-in cash you get, the better a deal may be.  Justin Sullivan/Staff/Getty Images News Should I Wait for a Sale to Buy an iPhone?  Nope.

MARCO_28_545748290-1	"What Are the Advantages of Using an iPhone?  | Small Business - Chron.com What Are the Advantages of Using an iPhone?  Small Business | Business Communications & Etiquette | Presentations By Scott Cornell Due to increased competition, Apple's iPhone is less synonymous with the term ""smartphone"" than it was in earlier years.  While the iPhone is being challenged by other brands, such as Android and Samsung, it's still the go-to phone for many users.  The iPhone offers a sleek design, is user friendly, features fast browsing speeds and is currently available from all the major U.S. cell service providers.  There are several other features and advantages that make iPhone a must-have among users.  FaceTime One big benefit exclusive to the iPhone and other Apple devices is the FaceTime feature, which uses the phone's front-facing camera to enable video chats with other iPhone users in high definition.  Previously only available to be used over Wi-Fi connections, you can now make FaceTime video calls over cellular data with the iPhone 5.  FaceTime is a personal way to stay in touch with family, friends and clients when geography presents a challenge.

MARCO_43_1536748853-2	The Apple Watch app is not available on iPod touch or iPad devices, and it cannot pair with Android devices at all either. Am I better off with an iPhone?  If you have an Apple Watch and plan on using it, then yes, because an iPhone is required to get it set up, even if you have the cellular version.  There are also plenty of other benefits of using an iPhone over an iPod touch.  The iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch Super Retina HD OLED Display (XS Max has 6.5-inches of screen), which is much more vibrant and has a higher resolution than the 4-inch Retina display of the iPod touch 7.  There are also better cameras (dual 12MP versus 8MP for rear, 7MP versus 1.2MP for front) with Portrait Mode and Lighting.  The iPhone XR even has a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, which is also better than the iPod touch 7.  Plus, with an iPhone, you'll be able to stay connected wherever you are due to a cellular data plan, versus the iPod touch that can only connect via Wi-Fi.	85.70727865802473
167	134_2-1	I've heard iPhones look and feel great. Should I get an iPhone?	MARCO_10_1605844582-4	For smaller companies that don't want to invest in the IT infrastructure for an Exchange server, for example, or for larger companies with unsupported BYOD programs, iCloud makes it easy for corporate iPhone users to keep their data safe. iCloud has the added benefit of allowing customers to remotely lock, locate, or erase their phones if they are lost or stolen; the automatic backup function allows users to be back up and running very quickly once they get a new phone.  The usefulness of this feature cannot be underestimated, as anyone who has ever lost a phone and then spent hours rebuilding their digital life will tell you.  Then there's the App Store, which includes a huge variety of the high-quality mobile apps.  Competitors in the mobile market Traditionally, Apple competed with other PC manufacturers such as Dell or HP.  But these days, since those companies don't really compete in the mobile space (instead selling lower-cost PCs or data center equipment that Apple doesn't offer), Apple's competition has changed significantly.  Apple is competing with Google and Amazon on services, including app, music, and book stores.  Google and Microsoft make competing smartphone and tablet operating systems.  Microsoft and Samsung are Apple's biggest competition in mobile hardware.	81.70213357685134

Last updated on March 31, 2019 Last Updated on May 2, 2019 by Husain Parvez The two most popular smartphones are the iPhone and Android phones.  They are developed by different companies and also have unique features.  Smartphone buyers are often torn between these types.  The choice of which one to pick depends largely on the specifications and capabilities which you are searching for.  While there were a number of other smartphone alternatives such as Windows Phone and Blackberry, they have since gone obsolete.  Therefore, majority of smartphones today are either iPhones or Android phones.  IPhone vs. Android: What Should You Get?  Here are some characteristics that can guide your choice as you pick the right one.  Apple vs Android – Easy To Use If you’re searching for a smartphone that is easy to use, the iPhone is a better pick.  This smartphone has a simple interface that is easy to learn, use and maintain.  It provides you with a home-screen which contains a collection of icons.  You can also personalize it with a photo.  Thus, it is uncluttered and easy to utilize.  iPhone or Android – Maximum Control Sometimes you may want to have extra control over your smartphone.	81.59242326486856
169	134_2-3	Which iPhone should I get?	MARCO_45_141802555-8	Still, Apple’s conservative approach to iPhone means that the user experience seldom changes, things just get faster and better. And plenty of people prefer this.  Which Android Phone Should You Get?  Samsung Phones – Great For Design & Specs OnePlus Phones – Brilliant Design, Amazing Software Google Pixel Phones – Best For Camera & Software Updates OPPO Phones – Great For Specs, Hardware & Fast-Charging Capabilities What About A Phone’s Specs?  Should You Care?  CPU When it comes to CPUs, the Android market is dominated by one brand – Qualcomm.  The vast majority of Android phones you can buy today use one of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors; either its high-end, performance chips like the Snapdragon 865 or its cheaper mid-range SoCs like the SD 765G or 690 which you’ll find in sub-£300 phones.  Apple’s iPhones ( and iPads) run on the company’s insanely powerful A-Series SoCs – the A13 is currently the most powerful mobile CPU on the market right now and you’ll find it inside the iPhone 11 range and the cheaper iPhone SE 2020.  This is what makes the iPhone SE 2020 so darn appealing; it’s a £419 smartphone with a flagship-grade CPU inside it.  Does your phone’s CPU matter?	80.00006039300933

Author: Lindsay Ingram Publish date: Nov 28, 2014 1:18 PM EST Here are 10 Android phones that are better than the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- iPhone users almost have it easy when choosing a new phone, currently the best options are the big iPhone 6, or the bigger iPhone 6 Plus.  Choosing an Android phone can be a bit harder since there are so many options available.  With that wide selection comes more competition, though, and there's an argument to be made that some of the phones are even better than the iPhone, no matter which iPhone you're talking about.  What makes an Android phone better than an iPhone is all based on what you value in a phone.  Maybe you want a more durable, waterproof phone, or a phone with a different design and more color options.  Maybe you really, really want a stylus and a huge display.  Or it could be as simple as you prefer to be locked into Google's ecosystem instead of Apple's because hey, no one company's products are right for everyone.	77.96297902055085
171	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	88.68480607771926
172	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_58_421808238-17	You might also like to include some minor weight training and some cross-training such as swimming, cycling, and walking, as these will work other parts of your body as well as giving you a break from running but still providing you with exercise and stress relief. Additionally, if you're not already running, speak with your doctor about taking up this strenuous sport if you have any fitness concerns.  If you're in bad shape, don't give up; just take it more slowly and be very kind to your body as you get used to the running and exercises.  The beauty of running is that you will gradually improve your fitness and stamina.  Do push ups and sit ups every day.  This will strengthen your upper body, which is also vital in a race.  Start with fifteen push-ups and twenty-five sit-ups and work your way up.  You may discover that your calves and hamstrings get a little sore if you're not already a seasoned runner.  This is a good thing; it means that you're working the muscle in a way it's never been used before.  This is similar to when you go to the gym after a long absence and do a complete weightlifting workout.	88.2803804027426
173	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_09_487355808-3	If you are a beginner to running, start out with a brisk walk and add 1 to 2 minutes of running every 5 minutes of walking. As you get more fit, you can increase the minutes you run until you don’t need to walk in between.  3 Swimming The pool may be a great place to float lazily along, but that water can also be a full body fitness challenge.  Swimming laps or even participating in water fitness classes will not only raise your heart rate and improve your heart health, the water provides multi-directional resistance that will improve your muscular strength and tone.  Swimming is a safe alternative if you have joint problems that walking or running can aggravate.  4 Cycling Another cardiovascular activity that is easy on the joints, cycling is a low-impact exercise that you can do solo in the gym, in a spin class, or outside on the road or trails.  Make efficient use of your cycling time and bike to work or to do your errands.  Even better, join a cycling club and enjoy the camraderie.  While your heart is pumping you’ll also be building strength and toning your lower body as well as your core muscles, if you take your bike off-road.	81.24748699530028
174	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_52_483672706-4	Any kind of strength training. Cool Down For Running After running, a good cool down can be a brisk walk for 2-3 minutes, gradually tapering your pace or stroll.  Sprinting is the same concept, but start with jogging, then taper down to walking.  This will be followed by static stretches that aim to increase the range of motion and flexibility of your lower body.  Start with standing stretches, then seated stretches.  As you can see, it’s a gradual pace to bring your body down to normal levels and relaxation.  Cool Down for Resistance & Strength Training After resistance training, you will want to do a mobility cool down routine.  This involves gentle bodyweight movements and stretching.  It’s like a yoga flow, where you move in an out of movements, holding stretches for 5-10 seconds (although you can hold stretches longer if you want, as after a workout it is fine).  We have an example of this kind of routine further below (see 4-Min Cool Down Routine).  Note: Make sure you emphasize stretches for areas you worked most in your workout.  So, if it was an upper body day, focus on your upper body more.  If it was a full body day, you can do an evenly targeted full body cool down.	79.69640363473445
175	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_50_2479500095-11	So it’s not only great to include in your cool down exercises but also recommended since your core is, well, your core. 6.  Jumping jacks Now we get back into lighter exercises that also work well for cool down exercises.  A favourite is a jumping jack. 7.  Swimming If you have access to a pool at your home or your gym, a quick dip in the pool can be great for cooldowns. 8.  Get a Massage Okay, this one doesn't exercise on the face of it, but it can be effective as many cool down exercises.  The point of cool down exercises is to transition your body from exerting to rest.  Part of that is getting rid of pooled blood left over from when your veins and arteries pumping blood the body didn’t need anymore. 9.  Exercise specific drills This one is a little complex but bear with me.  If you’re a runner, you’ll obviously be working out your legs most of all.  So doing some squats after a run keeps your legs pumping without the stress of actually running.  These can be wonderful cooldown exercises. 10.  Exercise mimicry Now I’m getting into the complicated sounding stuff.  Oddly enough, it’s still not that complicated.	75.49236662685871
176	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_50_2479500095-10	Walking The creme de la creme of cool down exercises, according to our research, is walking. It doesn’t matter what kind of work out you do; taking a nice walk afterwards always seems to be toward the top of all the lists.  2  . Stretch those legs While this mostly applies to runners, a great cool down exercise is stretching your legs.  This includes all the classics like pulling your leg up behind you to stretch your hamstring or trying to touch your toes.  There are other, more complex stretches that more or less stretch the same areas.  3  . Stretch your chest A few of our cool down exercise choices will be stretching.  This is just a heads up because they’re very effective for cooling down and they’re all pretty easy to do.  A popular one is lacing your fingers behind your back, straightening out your arms and looking at the ceiling.  This is effective at stretching your chest muscles.  4. Stretch your arms If you’ve ever noticed, even runners stretch their arms before they go running.  Consequently, it’s also one of the more effective cooldown exercises.  It helps to get your shoulders and your arms loosened up.  5.  Stretch out your core The core of your body is often something that gets overlooked in both stretching and exercise in general.	75.39454857446253
177	135_1-5	What strength exercises do you recommend to mix with running?	MARCO_51_714986228-9	Add some weights to your lunges and squats to go into full Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson mode. 5.  Plank Planks are deceptively simple, but they’re one of the best core exercises for running.  When done correctly, they should have your entire body shaking after a 45-second hold.  We dare you to hold it for as long as you can!  Begin in a push-up position with your hands on the floor, directly beneath your shoulders with your feet in-line with your hips If necessary, modify by dropping to your forearms or knees Imagine one straight line running through the crown of your head to the heels of your feet, with energy actively driving out through either end Contract all the muscles in your body and hold for at least 30 seconds Release, and work your way up to holds lasting from 45 seconds to over 1 minute Core exercises for runners help stabilize your torso and make all your movements more efficient.  When you have a strong core, you can breathe easier through exertion, power up steep hills, and stay steady on slippery sidewalks.  6.  Side Plank Oh boy, you’re in for it now.  To target your oblique abs—which feed into your hip flexors—take your standard plank and flip it on its side!	79.89421041496098
178	135_1-5	What strength exercises do you recommend to mix with running?	MARCO_20_33582034-4	This exercise works your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and inner and outer thighs, making it very running specific. How to do it: Stand sideways onto a knee-high bench or step.  Place your nearest foot on the top of the bench.  Drive your foot down into the bench and leap up and over.  Extend your leg fully and try and generate lots of height.  Use your arms for extra momentum.  Land with your opposite foot on the top of the platform.  Without pausing, jump back over the bench.  3.  Scorpion This running exercise works your lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.  It’s also good for lower back and hip mobility.  If you find this exercise difficult, you may need to work on your general flexibility and mobility.  A lot of runners have tight muscles and struggle with exercises that involve large ranges of motion.  How to do it: Lie on your front with your legs straight and your arms out to the side to form a T-shape.  Look straight down at the floor.  Bend your left knee, lift your leg, and try and touch your outstretched right arm with your foot.  Don’t worry if you can’t reach – just go as far as you can.  Return to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side.	77.48522158153355
179	135_1-5	What strength exercises do you recommend to mix with running?	MARCO_51_971379877-3	Implement ABC drills/coordination ABC drills are exercises that focus on specific movements to improve your running technique and coordination. The better our muscles work together, the more efficiently and effectively you can run.  I do various drills after warming up with my runners, and I want to show you three of those exercises.  Start by implementing the drills once a week.  Repeat each exercise two to three times for 20-30 meters.  Butt kickers: Stand straight and start with easy running.  Bring one heel towards your glutes and then switch to the other side.  Kick your butt with every stride.  You can use active running arms or hold your arms still next to your body.  Straight-leg run: This exercise might make you laugh, but it improves your running coordination and promotes your mid-foot strike.  Keep your legs and your upper body straight.  Point your toes upward.  Make sure you land on your forefoot.  Your arms swing easily next to your body.  High-knee drills: Start practicing on the spot.  Lift your knees high to a 90-degree angle.  Start to get a feeling for the movement.  Once you are in the flow, start running.  Keep focusing on high knees and running tall and light.  Lean forward slightly.  What are you waiting for?	76.75287047866732

181	135_1-7	Awesome. Can I do these strength routines and run on the same day?	MARCO_34_1286244718-7	However, as you get more and more advanced, this type of scenario won't work nearly as well since you're sending multiple mixed messages to your body. Monday's workout would tell your body it's time to get big, but then Wednesday's workout will kick your body into a bit of strength mode.  Finally, Friday's workout will run counter to Monday's and place the emphasis on raw strength.  What is a confused body to do?!  As you become more proficient, you have to dial up the focus and be the orchestrator to your symphony of muscles (and thus, training).  It's kind of why an elite level sprinter can't simply wake up one day, decide to run a marathon, and hope to be awesome at both distances.  While I'm saying that you need to spend time on both ends of the neural-metabolic continuum, you need to have some patience and zero-in your efforts on one at a time.  The general rule is to spend at least 4-6 weeks focusing on one end before you even think about heading to the other.  The Final Step: Autoregulation Hopefully, you're now alternating between periods of high-rep and low-rep training—awesome!	89.52955986006737

Bodyweight HIIT Circuit This circuit is NOT for the faint of heart!  It mixes bodyweight training exercises with quarter-mile sprints, setting a punishing pace that will push you to the limits of your endurance.  The day you can complete it, however, is the day that you will be in AMAZING shape.  The Workout: Spend the first five minutes stretching your legs and core.  This workout is going to hurt!  Sprint or run ¼ mile (400 meters) as fast as you can.  Perform 2 sets of 15 push-ups, with 60 seconds of rest between sets.  Sprint or run ¼ mile (400 meters) as fast as you can.  Perform 2 sets of 10 falling push-ups.  Start in a kneeling position and fall forward, catch yourself, drop into a push-up, and push off your hands back up to the kneeling position.  Rest for 60 seconds between sets.  Sprint or run ¼ mile (400 meters) as fast as you can.  Jump rope for 120 seconds.  Make sure to mix in one-leg hops, double jumps, and alternating feet.

187	135_3-1	Okay. Are there better calorie-burning exercises to try asides from running?	MARCO_07_257257718-2	This is because the cardio equipments are the high end costly products that bring the maximum profits to the seller and thus he advertises and markets them as the most beneficial for health and fat loss. To burn the maximum amount of bodyfat in the least amount of time, it is ideal to have a good combination of diet, weight training and cardio.  So yes, cardio is helpful in weight loss.  However if one is to only rely on cardio then the results will not be optimal, especially if a lot of weight is to be lost.  The problem with regular cardio like running, cycling, etc is that the body soon adapts to the relatively low intensity of these activities and thus actually burns lesser calories per minute with time.  On the other hand some of the more intense cardio alternatives like kickboxing, sprinting are a better choice as they involve an element of strength training in it and can provide a better long term weight loss.  So if one were to only rely on intense cardio choices like kickboxing for weight loss, then it will be ideal to add some squats, push ups, and other bodyweight exercises to get better results.

188	135_3-1	Okay. Are there better calorie-burning exercises to try asides from running?	MARCO_37_633485404-3	PLANKING FOR 1000 CALORIES Again, planking will not burn the most amount of calories in the shortest amount of time. Roughly 4 calories per minute for a 150-lb person is not a lot.  1000 calories equate to 250 minutes.  This looks very challenging but there are a lot of ways to make this more manageable.  It will take longer than a week but planking can help you burn a lot more than 1000 calories.  Here’s a simple workout plan that is both simple enough to follow and will help you burn more than 1000 calories in a month.  There are numerous 30-day plank challenges that you can try that would get you on the road to burning calories.  Some variations of the plank will burn more calories like the extended arm plank and the forearm side plank and other variations that are going to incorporate movements like the high plank shoulder taps and low plank knee taps.  Just keep in mind that as you progress to more advanced versions of the plank, you are indeed burning more calories but you need to make sure that you follow strict form for each variation to maximize its effect.  Not doing so can not only lessen your benefits, it could open you up for possible injuries.  FOREARM PLANK VS HIGH PLANK The high plank is known as the traditional plank (3).	79.31307435408235
189	135_3-3	I don’t have an indoor bike and neither am I great at skiing. What good alternative to running is there asides from indoor cycling and cross-country skiing?	MARCO_18_2943050931-5	Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.  Environmental impacts See also: Environmental impact of tourism and Vegetation and slope stability The process of resort development have progressed since the birth of the skiing industry.

Thanks El Nino!  Skiers and snowboarders everywhere out west rejoice.  But what if you don’t like to ski?  There are still a ton of things to do in Idaho during the winter.  Here are 7 creative ways to get into the winter spirit beyond the slopes.  1) Dog sled through the state’s mountain landscapes.  Most people may think of Alaska or Canada when they hear dog sledding, but Idaho has a long mushing history as well.  Originating back in 1917, Ashton’s annual American Dog Derby is the longest-standing all-American dog sled race in the Lower 48.  Held every year in the third week of February, this two-day event draws the best dog sled teams in North America to race from Ashton, Idaho, to the west corner of Yellowstone National Park, a 55-mile endeavor.	79.98953164834529

MARCO_30_89583066-5	The jump rope is small and does not take up much space, and you can even take it with you on vacation for a quick workout. Additionally, the exercise itself does not require much space, so you can exercise anywhere.  Also, you don’t even need much to warm up.  All you need to do is take 5 minutes to warm up with some light jumps followed by some higher intensity ones.  Wrapping up Overall, the jump rope is the best companion you can have when it comes to burning fat and building muscle.  Although some might come across as skeptical over its benefits, the jump rope has always been part of the main training session for many athletes and it brings numerous advantages.  It is beneficial not only in terms of weight loss and building muscle but also to help you maintain good heart health.  It is extremely versatile and engages all of your muscles, including your core, legs, and arms.  Most importantly, you can take it anywhere with you and practice either indoors or outdoors.

Always warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting any exercise.  Jump rope Equipment: gym shoes (sneakers), jump rope Benefits: Jumping rope helps develop better body awareness, hand-foot coordination, and agility.  Safety: Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height.  Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits.  That’s the height you’re going for.  If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope.  Duration and frequency: 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space.  Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete.  If you’re a beginner: Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet.  Do this move for 15 seconds.  Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope.  Do this move for 15 seconds.  Finish your set by doing a hopscotch jump for 15 seconds.	76.26314020482823
195	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	88.68480607771926
196	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_58_421808238-17	You might also like to include some minor weight training and some cross-training such as swimming, cycling, and walking, as these will work other parts of your body as well as giving you a break from running but still providing you with exercise and stress relief. Additionally, if you're not already running, speak with your doctor about taking up this strenuous sport if you have any fitness concerns.  If you're in bad shape, don't give up; just take it more slowly and be very kind to your body as you get used to the running and exercises.  The beauty of running is that you will gradually improve your fitness and stamina.  Do push ups and sit ups every day.  This will strengthen your upper body, which is also vital in a race.  Start with fifteen push-ups and twenty-five sit-ups and work your way up.  You may discover that your calves and hamstrings get a little sore if you're not already a seasoned runner.  This is a good thing; it means that you're working the muscle in a way it's never been used before.  This is similar to when you go to the gym after a long absence and do a complete weightlifting workout.	88.2803804027426
197	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_09_487355808-3	If you are a beginner to running, start out with a brisk walk and add 1 to 2 minutes of running every 5 minutes of walking. As you get more fit, you can increase the minutes you run until you don’t need to walk in between.  3 Swimming The pool may be a great place to float lazily along, but that water can also be a full body fitness challenge.  Swimming laps or even participating in water fitness classes will not only raise your heart rate and improve your heart health, the water provides multi-directional resistance that will improve your muscular strength and tone.  Swimming is a safe alternative if you have joint problems that walking or running can aggravate.  4 Cycling Another cardiovascular activity that is easy on the joints, cycling is a low-impact exercise that you can do solo in the gym, in a spin class, or outside on the road or trails.  Make efficient use of your cycling time and bike to work or to do your errands.  Even better, join a cycling club and enjoy the camraderie.  While your heart is pumping you’ll also be building strength and toning your lower body as well as your core muscles, if you take your bike off-road.	81.24748699530028
198	135_2-1	Cool. Do you have any tips to lose weight by running?	MARCO_00_741017181-6	When you start your running program, make a simultaneous effort to eat fewer foods from the right-hand column and more from the left-hand column — especially from the top of the left-hand column. There is proof that it works.  Earlier this year, Danish researchers reported new runners seeking weight loss who ran more than 5km (3.1 miles) per week for one year but did not change their diets lost an average of 8.4 pounds.  Meanwhile, new runners seeking weight loss who ran more than 5km (3.1 miles) per week for one year and did change their diets lost an average of 12.3 pounds.  HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT FASTER Even 12.3 pounds of weight loss in one year might not seem like a lot.  If your goal is bigger than that, there are two things you can do: Run more and eat less.  While it’s important to progress slowly, you can continue to progress with your running until you are doing as much as you can with the time, energy and motivation you have.  If you are highly motivated, consider aiming for a long-term goal of building up to 60 minutes of running per day, six days per week.	92.82444622504408

MARCO_20_91291233-2	Change Your Diet No matter how hard you exercise, you may never achieve your weight loss goals if have poor eating habits. Changing your diet will help you get better results from your running workouts.  According to this Danish study, new runners who changed their diets lost an average of 12.3 pounds (5.5kgs) running over 5km (3 miles) per week in a year compared to those who didn’t change their diets who lost on the average 8.4 pounds during the same period and exercise intensity.  Some of the diet changes you should make include cutting back on processed foods, eating high-fiber foods, eating more protein, eating more healthy fats, and avoiding sugary drinks.  2.  Track Your Macros Have you been running regularly but can’t see any change in your waistline, even after adopting healthier eating habits?  The problem could be the amount of food you eat.  Simply eating healthy foods doesn’t guarantee that you will lose belly fat.  You have to eat fewer calories than you do burn in order to lose belly fat by running.  You can avoid the common mistake of overeating by tracking your calories.  Go to CalorieKing and search for the calorie content of the foods you eat regularly.  Note that tracking calories can turn into an unhealthy obsession.	85.60415845550597

This is by far the most important thing to do if you are serious about losing some weight.  2. Increase the intensity of your runs.

You can do a variety of different running workouts to help you get the most out of each run.  3.  Eat more fruits and vegetables.  Also, eat less of everything else.  I don't recommend one diet over another, but eating more ""real"" foods like fruits and veggies which have all the vitamins and minerals you need naturally will help you with your weight loss goals.

204	135_2-5	What if I run on an empty stomach to lose weight?	MARCO_51_971491333-3	“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.	92.10882252661249

You can run further thanks to the caloric boost you get from food.  Cons For some runners, even small snacks trigger stomach upsets.  You could feel bloated, experience ""sloshing"" or cramps if you eat first.  Even beneficial fiber may cause distress, says University of Adelaide Exercise and Sports Science lecturer David Bentley.

212	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_09_18864409-2	When we exercise, the opposite occurs; blood flow is redirected from internal organs to the large working muscles to provide the necessary energy for muscle contraction. When we have a large amount of food in our stomach, running is difficult or uncomfortable because our body is simply not designed to do both digestion and exercise at the same time.  Stomach cramps, stomach aches, or gastro-intestinal distress are the most common complaints when trying to run on a full stomach.  The mechanical mixing and jostling that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract too.  Now that said, some athletes are able to eat and run.  Endurance athletes train their bodies to eat on the run.  Even at the marathon distance, runners must ingest some nutrition during the race, although hardly a large meal.  Experimenting in your training with eating and running will let you know just how much you are able to eat before a run.  For the best training results though, allow three to four hours after eating before running, especially if the workout calls for some intensity.  All the best, Susan Paul, MS	85.40910960722249

While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.	91.47739850695508
215	135_2-11	So is it best to avoid running on an empty stomach as a leisure athlete?	MARCO_42_707092932-6	If you prefer to run on an empty stomach, stick to light to moderate running. Take a break if you start to feel lightheaded.  The exception is if you’re running a long distance or doing a high-intensity run.  These activities require a lot of energy, so it’s wise to eat before.  Healthy snacks before and after running If you do want to eat before a run, choose a light snack.  Focus on healthy carbs.  Eat your snack 1 to 3 hours before running.  Ideal pre-workout snacks include: whole grain cereal whole wheat toast banana apple yogurt granola bar without added sugars After running, eat lean protein and healthy carbs within 2 hours.  These nutrients will support muscle recovery and replenish your glycogen stores.  Examples of good post-workout meals include: turkey sandwich with whole wheat bread and vegetables oatmeal and peanut butter yogurt and fruit salmon with avocado and quinoa fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt and nut butter Also, drink water before, during, and after your run.  It’s the best way to avoid dehydration due to exercise.  When to talk with a pro It’s possible to maintain a running routine on your own.	87.17288827110315
216	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	88.68480607771926
217	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_58_421808238-17	You might also like to include some minor weight training and some cross-training such as swimming, cycling, and walking, as these will work other parts of your body as well as giving you a break from running but still providing you with exercise and stress relief. Additionally, if you're not already running, speak with your doctor about taking up this strenuous sport if you have any fitness concerns.  If you're in bad shape, don't give up; just take it more slowly and be very kind to your body as you get used to the running and exercises.  The beauty of running is that you will gradually improve your fitness and stamina.  Do push ups and sit ups every day.  This will strengthen your upper body, which is also vital in a race.  Start with fifteen push-ups and twenty-five sit-ups and work your way up.  You may discover that your calves and hamstrings get a little sore if you're not already a seasoned runner.  This is a good thing; it means that you're working the muscle in a way it's never been used before.  This is similar to when you go to the gym after a long absence and do a complete weightlifting workout.	88.2803804027426
218	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_09_487355808-3	If you are a beginner to running, start out with a brisk walk and add 1 to 2 minutes of running every 5 minutes of walking. As you get more fit, you can increase the minutes you run until you don’t need to walk in between.  3 Swimming The pool may be a great place to float lazily along, but that water can also be a full body fitness challenge.  Swimming laps or even participating in water fitness classes will not only raise your heart rate and improve your heart health, the water provides multi-directional resistance that will improve your muscular strength and tone.  Swimming is a safe alternative if you have joint problems that walking or running can aggravate.  4 Cycling Another cardiovascular activity that is easy on the joints, cycling is a low-impact exercise that you can do solo in the gym, in a spin class, or outside on the road or trails.  Make efficient use of your cycling time and bike to work or to do your errands.  Even better, join a cycling club and enjoy the camraderie.  While your heart is pumping you’ll also be building strength and toning your lower body as well as your core muscles, if you take your bike off-road.	81.24748699530028

MARCO_07_257257718-2	This is because the cardio equipments are the high end costly products that bring the maximum profits to the seller and thus he advertises and markets them as the most beneficial for health and fat loss. To burn the maximum amount of bodyfat in the least amount of time, it is ideal to have a good combination of diet, weight training and cardio.  So yes, cardio is helpful in weight loss.  However if one is to only rely on cardio then the results will not be optimal, especially if a lot of weight is to be lost.  The problem with regular cardio like running, cycling, etc is that the body soon adapts to the relatively low intensity of these activities and thus actually burns lesser calories per minute with time.  On the other hand some of the more intense cardio alternatives like kickboxing, sprinting are a better choice as they involve an element of strength training in it and can provide a better long term weight loss.  So if one were to only rely on intense cardio choices like kickboxing for weight loss, then it will be ideal to add some squats, push ups, and other bodyweight exercises to get better results.

Roughly 4 calories per minute for a 150-lb person is not a lot.  1000 calories equate to 250 minutes.  This looks very challenging but there are a lot of ways to make this more manageable.  It will take longer than a week but planking can help you burn a lot more than 1000 calories.  Here’s a simple workout plan that is both simple enough to follow and will help you burn more than 1000 calories in a month.  There are numerous 30-day plank challenges that you can try that would get you on the road to burning calories.  Some variations of the plank will burn more calories like the extended arm plank and the forearm side plank and other variations that are going to incorporate movements like the high plank shoulder taps and low plank knee taps.  Just keep in mind that as you progress to more advanced versions of the plank, you are indeed burning more calories but you need to make sure that you follow strict form for each variation to maximize its effect.

MARCO_18_2943050931-5	Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.  Environmental impacts See also: Environmental impact of tourism and Vegetation and slope stability The process of resort development have progressed since the birth of the skiing industry.

MARCO_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.  It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	84.5822092462331

232	136_1-3	Oh wow. Why did the Nixon administration break in at Democratic National Committee?	MARCO_02_627068903-11	(See: Watergate babies) Indirectly, Watergate was the cause of new laws leading to extensive changes in campaign financing.  It was a major factor in the passage of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act in 1986, as well as laws requiring new financial disclosures by key government officials.  While not legally required, other types of personal disclosure, such as releasing recent income tax forms, became expected.  Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt had recorded many of their conversations, but after Watergate this practice purportedly ended.  Watergate led to a new era in which the mass media became far more aggressive in reporting on the activities of politicians.  For instance, Wilbur Mills, a powerful congressman, was in a drunken driving accident.  The incident, similar to others which the press had previously never mentioned, was reported, and Mills soon had to resign from his position as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  In addition to reporters becoming more aggressive in revealing the personal conduct of key politicians, they also became far more cynical in reporting on political issues.  A new generation of reporters, hoping to become the next Woodward and Bernstein, embraced investigative reporting and sought to uncover new scandals in the increasing amounts of financial information being released about politicians and their campaigns.	86.1059760125354

Reporters at the Washington Post were uncovering links between the White House and the Watergate break-in.  The burglars who had not pleaded guilty—Liddy and McCord—went on trial on January 10, 1973, before Judge John Sirica.  The jury found them both guilty.  New doubts were raised when FBI Director Gray testified that Dean had sat in when Watergate witnesses were being interviewed and that he had turned over the FBI’s Watergate files to Dean.  The cover-up continued behind the scenes with Nixon’s knowledge and approval.  In a meeting on March 22, 1973, in the Oval Office with Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell and Dean present, Ehrlichman told Dean to say that nobody in the White House was involved, and Nixon chimed in: “That’s right.”  They discussed using executive privilege to limit questioning.

It ended only when Richard Nixon was forced to leave office.  Watergate was connected to Vietnam; it eventually exposed a long series of illegal activities in the Nixon administration.  Nixon and his staff were found to have spied on and harassed political opponents and to cover-up illegal activities.  These crimes were known as the Watergate scandal.  For years Nixon was carrying on the crimes and they had not come to light.  It all started when the White House staff made up a list called “enemies list”.  Nixon had enemies which included 200 liberal politicians, journalists, and actors.  Most of these “enemies” were opponents of the Vietnam War.  Nixon’s aides conducted tax audits on these individuals used agents to find information that would harm their credibility.  The president’s agents helped him by wiretapping phone lines that belonged to reporters in order to find any revealing material.  Nixon was so worried that during the Cambodia bombing he had to wiretap his own staff members.  In June 1971, The New York Times published a story about the history of the Vietnam War; these were known as the Pentagon Papers.  They had gotten the information from classified government documents.	72.77772598713636
237	136_1-7	Did Congress and federal prosecution get Nixon's taped conversations in the Oval Office?	WAPO_OCLL7TWVP5ALVIKWIOSHRUVCCU-5	Nixon famously asserted executive privilege to block the release of tapes capturing his coverup of the Watergate scandal, defying a congressional subpoena ordering him to turn most of them over. The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.  At first, he gave Congress 19 tapes — but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.  In a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him.  “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said on April 29, 1974.  He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove “irrelevant” information that was not subject to Congress’s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns and promising that the rest would be sufficient.  But to House leaders, it wasn’t.  Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said that “we will accept nothing less” than the tapes — and months later, they got them.  In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon’s claims of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes.	81.19161150604486

Nixon had microphones in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, his Executive Office Building office and the Aspen Lodge at Camp David, and also recorded phone calls in the Lincoln Sitting Room.  After the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes to Congress in the summer of 1974, prosecutors found they corroborated Dean’s testimony and implicated the president in the cover-up.  “  [  Dean] was first and one of the only, actually, in the higher echelons to give honest testimony,” Robenalt says.  “Other people who testified, including the chief of staff and the attorney general, they all went to jail for lying about what was going on.”  Dean made a deal where he received a reduced sentence for providing key witness testimony and pleading guilty to obstruction of justice.  He served four months in prison and was disbarred from practicing law in D.C. and Virginia.  Still, some of the higher-level Watergate conspirators didn’t actually get a much harsher punishments than Dean.  Former Attorney General John Mitchell and former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman each served a year and a half in jail for their involvement.	78.88252988178283

Representative Wiggins in particular dropped his support for Nixon after the revelation of this tape, saying later on August 5 that ""the facts then known to me have now changed,"" and that it was now obvious Nixon had a ""plan of action"" to cover up the break-in.  He believed that as a result, ""these facts standing alone are legally sufficient in my opinion to sustain at least one count against the President of conspiracy to obstruct justice.""  However, Wiggins said he would vote against the other articles, arguing that they would ""constitute unfortunate historical precedents if allowed to stand.""   The importance of Wiggins, who had been Nixon's ablest defender in committee, was emphasized by ""The New York Times"" front-page headline the next day: ""Wiggins for Impeachment; Others in G.O.P.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.  The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	85.3613324505277

But the effects of Watergate lingered on for years after the scandal.  The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.  But here are five significant trends that came out of a story that developed over two years and captivated the nation.  1.  The Supreme Court remained supreme.  It was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974 that effectively ended the Nixon presidency by ordering the release of the Watergate “smoking gun” tape and other recordings.	93.47529089497402

MARCO_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.  It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	84.5822092462331

On June 17, 1972, The Washington Post published a small story.  In this story, the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.  The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate.  These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers.  The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deeply into the story.  Their names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward; they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime.  The reporters suspected that the break-in had been ordered by other White House officials.  In a press conference in August of 1972, President Nixon said that nobody in the White House staff was involved in the crime.

Three of those arrested were Cuban exiles and one was a Cuban-American.  Their leader was James McCord, a former CIA agent and a security coordinator for President Richard Nixon’s Committee for the Reelection of the President.  Prosecutors also charged E.

We will have no way of knowing that we live in a simulation because we will never reach the technological capacity to realize the marks of a simulated reality.  Bostrom's argument rests on the premise that given sufficiently advanced technology, it is possible to represent the populated surface of the Earth without recourse to digital physics; that the qualia experienced by a simulated consciousness are comparable or equivalent to those of a naturally occurring human consciousness, and that one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world.  If one assumes first that humans will not be destroyed nor destroy themselves before developing such a technology, and that human descendants will have no overriding legal restrictions or moral compunctions against simulating biospheres or their own historical biosphere, then, Bostrom argues, it would be unreasonable to count ourselves among the small minority of genuine organisms who, sooner or later, will be vastly outnumbered by artificial simulations.  Epistemologically, it is not impossible to tell whether we are living in a simulation.  For example, Bostrom suggests that a window could pop up saying: ""You are living in a simulation.

Although   we   are   unlikely   to   get   proof,   we   might   find   some   hints   about   our   reality.    “I   think   it   might   be   feasible   to   get   evidence   that   would   at   least   give   weak   clues,”   says   Bostrom.

272	137_1-7	How would we know that we are living in a simulation?	MARCO_31_719719292-4	This principle, when applied to the case of simulation, says that the probability that we are living in a simulated world instead of a real one is equal to the fraction of all people that are actually simulated people. By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.  Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument.  However, this isn’t quite accurate.	77.72947061480954

MARCO_56_715074680-1	What is the Multiverse Theory? - Universe Today Posted on November 5, 2010 July 21, 2020 by Matt Williams What is the Multiverse Theory?  If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes.  The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically.  Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy.  In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.  In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own.  The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James.  However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	92.6368746208027

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in.  Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory.  For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering.  What Is It?  The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience.  These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously.  These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.”  What are These Parallel Universes?  These parallel universes, also called “braneworlds” by some, hover just beyond your reach.	91.33328524805256

Multiverse Theory The multiverse theory is one of the leading arguments about the origins of the Universe.  According to it, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of whom is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  The grid of Universes is known as a Multiverse, where each bubble, after springing into existence, expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light.  According to the Multiverse Theory, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of which is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  (Photo Credit: Silver Spoon / Wikimedia Commons)  This whimsical theory is corroborated by the CMBR and the theory of inflation, where the former is an indisputable proof of the Big Bang and the latter is a compelling explanation for the Universe’s homogeneity.  However, conclusive evidence has yet to come to light.  The theory essentially explores what might have existed before the Big Bang, a question that cannot be answered right now, as it requires knowledge of singularities, which we don’t yet fully possess, as mentioned earlier.	85.55353029706748

It's specifically said in dialogue on the show that the plot really begins about three weeks after the final battle against Thanos, and head writer Jac Schaeffer has confirmed that the events that play out happen over the course of about a week.  Spider-Man: Far From Home (Set in 2023)  Thus far, only one Marvel Cinematic Universe movie has been set in the aftermath of Avengers: Endgame, and that’s Spider-Man: Far From Home – which takes place in the summer of 2023 following the defeat of Thanos.	93.02651117104688

At times, when criticism is unavoidable, watch your tone.  4.  Encourage Extra Curricular Activities: Let your teenager follow his hobbies.  Encourage him to participate in more and more activities.  It is important for your teenager to excel at anything he likes and enjoys.  Extracurricular activities prove to be great opportunities for learning about success, failure, challenges and they add a great deal to your teenager’s confidence.  These activities build a positive team spirit in your teenager and help him learn about working together towards a common goal.  [ Read: Teenage Stress ] 5.  Support Optimistic Friendships: We know you cannot possibly control, pick and choose the kind of friends your teenager will make.  Teach him about respect and acceptance.  Mutual understanding and respect in any relation is important.  Teach him that value is what matters between friends.  The kind of friends your teenager makes also affects his self confidence.  Teach him ways to differentiate between good and fair weather friends.  6. Looks Do Not Matter: Most teenagers fall under peer pressure.  To them looks matter a lot.  They crave to look like models and celebs and inability to do so affects their self confidence immensely.  It is important to sit and explain to your teenager that looks do not matter.	96.84707622147994

The need for approval can lead teens to succumb to peer pressure as a way to feel accepted.  Bolster your teen’s confidence by showing that you love her unconditionally, even when she makes a bad decision.

Why even try?”  The motivation to try is lost.  Always be very specific when you are giving negative feedback.  And make sure your criticism is constructive.  Say “Look – this small step in this sum has made the whole answer wrong.  Let me explain the step to you again and then do 10 sums like this.  That will ensure that you will never make this mistake again.”  Do not be grumpy and complaining When teenagers don’t do well in academics – they typically start slipping in other areas of their lives as well.  They start keeping their rooms untidy, they neglect their personal hygiene like taking bath and brushing etc.  They dress untidily in crushed clothes and so on.  This can make you more and more irritated and you may look at your child in disgust whenever she/he is around you and start pointing out everything that is wrong with your child at all times of the day.  Do not do this.  It can be extremely demotivating.  This is the time to support your child and find out why your child is behaving like this with expert help – instead of constantly criticizing her/him.  First help your teen improve in academics.	84.36369530999013

MARCO_55_338420129-3	Social skills include behaviors such as making/maintaining eye contact, smiling and the give and take of compliments during social interactions. Kids with well-developed social skills tend to have largely positive social interactions and greater peer acceptance.  Teaching social skills is crucial for raising happy, positive and balanced kids.  How can you help your child develop better social skills?  Your child learns from the way you interact with others so make sure you are a role model for appropriate behavior.  This includes greeting people, being a good listener and practicing self-control.

Whether its a lack of personal space, a disregard for other’s feelings, or his inability to be flexible in a situation, my son struggles with everyday life activities that many children don’t have to even think twice about.  In exchange, he often feels isolated, picked on, and singled out.  He struggles with making the connection between socially acceptable behavior and his need for sensory input.  My son is not alone.  In fact, many times children struggle with these same skills and are pinpointed as a bully, the “mean” kid, non-compliant, or defiant.  When the truth is that these children, like my son, are spending so much energy trying to regulate their nervous system, that they do not have anything left for social cues and social “niceties”.  6 Simple Strategies to Teach Social Skills When it Doesn’t Come Easy #1 Educate Yourself The first step in teaching a child who struggles with social skills is to educate yourself on the possible reasons behind their lack of skills.  Is it a behavior management problem, a communication problem, or a problem with sensory integration.	80.10640787309967

289	138_1-7	Awesome. He cares a lot about looks also. What can I do about that?	MARCO_54_1938722770-24	A child with low self-esteem may feel unlovable, empty, and worthless. As a result, he/she may begin to believe that his/her loved ones and friends would be “better off” without them.  Child counselors can help this child improve his/her self-esteem and self-confidence in a myriad of ways.  For instance, a child counselor may teach a child with low self-esteem and self-confidence how to look at the big picture and dig deeper to find the root cause of the issues.  He/she may also help this child better understand how negative thoughts and self-talk is causing him/her to feel bad – mentally and physically.  This specialist can also explain to a child how positive self-talk can dramatically improve his/her self-esteem, self-confidence, and overall life.  Some of the things your child will learn in child counseling include the benefit of using positive affirmations to boost self-confidence and self-acceptance and the importance of talking to a loved one or trusted friend about distressing feelings and thoughts.

MARCO_56_429568222-13	Accomplishments I am Proud Of To help a child who has low self-esteem due to bullying, a counselor can have the child list accomplishments that the child is proud of and this will build self-confidence (Knapp, 2003). The child can either list events from his or her past that he or she is proud of or the child can draw a picture that illustrates the accomplishments.  When the child is feeling low or sad he or she can refer back to the list or drawing and it may be able to cheer the child up.  This can be used for children in grades 3-12 and the counselor should encourage the child to continue to add additional entries that can be referred to at a later date (Knapp, 2003).  Sources of the Low Self-esteem Did the child have low self-esteem before the bullying occurred?  Discuss with the child how the child feels because of the bullying and if the bullying stopped would they feel better about themselves.  The counselor could ask the child the “miracle question” which can help to goals in a clear and new way (Young, 2009).  An example of this is “If you woke up tomorrow morning, and a miracle occurred in your life, what would your life look like?”	78.44640261679888
291	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_23_941472041-2	How can we, as parents, coaches, advisors and mentors, help lessen that impact? And, most of all, how can we follow these same guidelines to set a good example for our kids?  How Social Media Lowers Our Teens’ Self-Esteem: It causes them to live in a world of self promotion No matter what they post, they measure their self-worth on how many “likes” or “comments” the post gets.  This turns the posting into an addiction and a determiner of their beauty, worth, popularity and validity.  If a post doesn’t get a lot of likes or receives a negative comment they may assume they must be uncool, stupid or not good enough.  How to prevent it: Encourage your teenager that their inner beauty, unique qualities and how they treat others are what more important.  Help them realize that anyone that measures their worth by their social media profiles, is not a true friend.  It makes them constantly compare themselves to others Social media provides a constant outlet for the trap of comparison which subsequently creates feelings of depression and low self-worth in many teens.  Pay attention to statements that use “like” and “as” from your teen.	89.85865816776641
292	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_23_941472041-3	For example, “I’m not as skinny as”, “I wish I looked like” or “I’m not as good as”. How to prevent it: As adults, we need to help our teenagers face the challenges social media brings.  If we allow our teenagers to use social media, then we need to parent more intently and deliberately.  We need to focus on nurturing their self-esteem and showing them that their self-worth should be rooted in being a good person, working hard and helping others, not in the cuteness of their outfit or how many followers they have on Instagram.  Since we can’t simply say “Keep your teen off social media until they are secure in their self-esteem”, encourage them to follow accounts that promote positive body image, lift others up and show good examples for your teen to follow.  Some examples of these are: @aerie @kindcampaign @soulpancake @amypoehlersmartgirls @thegoodquote It inhibits their experiences Many teens will participate in experiences (or not participate) “for the Instagram”.  If they think going to a new place in town or even spending some time outside will make for a good picture, they are more inclined to participate.  How to prevent it: Show your teen by example that experiences don’t always need to be photographed.	83.11496881092899

Tackling Your Teen’s Self Esteem In an article published by the Child Development Institute (CDI), Self-esteem: How to Help Children & Teens Develop a Positive Self Image, the agency noted the importance of self talk to improve self-esteem.  According to the CDI, it is important to “teach your child to practice making positive self-statements.  Self-talk is very important in everything we do.  Psychologists and Mental Health Care providers have found that negative self-talk is behind depression and anxiety.  What we think determines how we feel and how we feel determines how we behave.  Consequently, it is important to teach children to be positive about how they talk to themselves.  “ Parents’ Role Parental involvement is critical to counteract the negative effects social media may have on their teen’s self-esteem.  Social media is notorious for feeding social stereotypes related to race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and disabilities, to name a few.	79.5634497301653

This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem.  For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts.  Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves.  Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually.  Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth.  Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought.  Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again.  Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem.

So, change the conversation to overcome issues with self-esteem for teens.  Esteem-Building Tips Besides rewriting the inner dialogue, help your teen take these steps to improve self-worth: Celebrate what they do well.  Focus on effort instead of perfection.  Reframe mistakes into learning opportunities.  Pinpoint trigger thoughts that cause low self-esteem.  Get adventurous and try new things.  Own their decisions and opinions.  Give back to others through volunteering.  Make wise decisions.  Support your teen’s growth and development by being generous with praise.  This doesn’t mean telling your son or daughter that they’re smart or good-looking.  It means diving into specific situations where they performed well (e.g. cleaning their room, getting a B+ on their math test.)  Use this descriptive praise to celebrate good choices and hard work.  Decision Making and Self-Esteem Decision making remains crucial to a teen’s success.  Yet, developing decision-making skills is an often overlooked process.  And it requires practice.  So, find decision-making opportunities and guide your teen through them.	72.4209207650274

A number of ancient civilizations settled in the region and left their relics in the form of amazing monuments and structures.  At the same time, there are also many natural wonders in the region which attract interested tourists from all parts of the globe.  Discover some of the most spectacular of these landmarks through the following discussion.  The Great Wall of China One of the most famous landmarks in Asia is the Great Wall of China which is the world’s longest man-made structures.  It is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.  It consists of sections built by different Chinese dynasties during different periods of time.  The combined length of all the sections is 6,300 kilometers.  Quick Facts The oldest section of the Great Wall of China was built around 2,000 years back.  The structure was added to the list of the Great National and Historical Sites of the World in 1987 by UNESCO.  During the construction of the wall, over a million labors lost their lives.  It was, therefore, also known as the world’s longest cemetery.	93.0444829549524

The 500-year-old Great Wall of China is one of the most famous landmarks of Asia and according to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei who orbited in 2003, it can’t be seen from the moon.

MARCO_21_1394706798-5	The restoration and preservation initiatives are being taken up by the government and other non-governmental bodies like the International Friends of the Great Wall and The China Great Wall Society who clean the areas surrounding the most frequently visited areas of the wall and keep a close check on the structural maintenance. Through Western contact with China from the 17th through 20th centuries, the fame of the Great Wall grew and so did tourism.  It grew at a whopping rate after President Nixon visited the wall in 1972.  Today, a portion of the Great Wall of China, about 80 km from Beijing, is host to about 6 million tourists every year.  Many historians have a view that by building a wall of this length, the manpower that went into it, and the deaths reported or assumed during the construction, it would have caused lesser casualties even if another kingdom would have attacked and gotten into a war with China.  But from accounts of the Chinese, the wall stands as a representation of their unity and pride.  Like it?  Share it!  « Previous Post Next Post »	82.32451877743006
307	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_21_1387590590-4	But the wall was expensive to maintain and to garrison, and it could always be breached with a bribe to a corrupt commander. Over the centuries the wall fell into disrepair at various times and places.  In the 15th century China’s Ming dynasty rulers rebuilt the Great Wall for 5500 miles along China’s northern and western borders.  In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea).  The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire.  Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier.  It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads.  Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world.  In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	81.02839030697942

The final construction work done on the wall was back in 1878 in the later phases of the Qing Dynasty, which existed from 1644 to 1911.  The construction and maintenance stopped since the wall was rendered obsolete by more advanced weaponry such as fire and explosives.  The Great Wall of China Today The Great Wall of China.

Some sections have been renovated in recent times, while others have been destroyed.  Some of the best and most widely known sections from the Ming Dynasty include Jinshanling, Simatai, Mutianyu, and Badaling.  The Great Wall of China is a popular tourist attraction offering magnificent views, with several sections having been declared 5A-rated tourist attractions, which in the rating categories used by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism means these sections are among the most important and best-maintained tourist destinations of the country.	80.66308983974159

MARCO_18_1914156314-21	In addition to rebuilding the walls, archeologists believe that the Han also erected thousands of kilometres of walls from Hebei to Inner Mongolia during Emperor Wu's reign. The fortifications here include embankments, beacon stations, and forts, all constructed with a combination of tamped-earth cores and stone frontages.  From the Ordos Loop, the sporadic and non-continuous Han Great Wall followed the northern edge of the Hexi Corridor through the cities of Wuwei, Zhangye, and Jiuquan, leading into the Juyan Lake Basin, and terminating in two places: the Yumen Pass in the north, or the Yang Pass to the south, both in the vicinity of Dunhuang.  Yumen Pass was the most westerly of all Han Chinese fortifications – further west than the western terminus of the Ming Great Wall at Jiayu Pass, about 460 kilometres (290 mi) to the east.  The garrisons of the watchtowers on the wall were supported by civilian farming and by military agricultural colonies known as tuntian.  Behind this line of fortifications, the Han government was able to maintain its settlements and its communications to the Western Regions in central Asia, generally secure from attacks from the north.	85.5796444953885

It was much farther north than the current wall.  The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty.  Contents 1 History 2 Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall 3 Visibility from space 4 References 5 Other websites History The First Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang also called Shi Huangdi, started the Qin Dynasty.  The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies.  The land in some parts of China is easy to cross, so Qin Shi Huang started building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China.  Other dynasties in China had worked more on the wall and made it longer.  The Han, Sui, Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired, rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall.  During the Ming Dynasty, major rebuilding work took place.  Sections of the wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth.  It took more than 2000 years for building and completion of the Great wall.  Construction and rebuilding of the Great Wall Builders used materials that were nearby.  Some parts of the wall were made of mud, straw, and twigs.  Thousands of workers died from giant falling stones, exhaustion, disease, animal attacks, and starvation.	72.47564227879047

Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.  An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above riverbank.  In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.  Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.  The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.   The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took efforts from 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.	88.50035860587377

Awaiting your revert.  Happy holidays!  Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well!  My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such.  It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another.  So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities.  I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing.  The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights.  Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	92.46687950519843

318	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_01_1752388157-8	It is one of the freaks of history that this 'Wonder of the World,’ which is least characteristic of Mughal art, has become the classic representative and emblem of Mughal civilization. The construction of the Taj Mahal was entrusted to a board of architects under imperial supervision, as was customary during the reign of Shah Jahan.  The architects involved included Abd ul-Karim Ma'mur Khan, Makramat Khan, and Ustad Ahmed Lahwari.  Born in Lahore, Ustad Ahmed was not only a renowned architect but also a mathematician and astronomer of high repute.  Besides the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort in Delhi should be attributed to him as well.  Okada and Joshi write that the monument stands as testimony to the technical skills and scientific knowledge of its builders.  This is evident from the excellent handling of material and the perfect use of constructional devices: the arches used in raising the grand dome and distributing its heavy weight evenly, the method of laying the foundation, and the subtle manipulation of minute details.  The entire complex is planned in such a way that the apparent organic unity of the whole does not obscure the individuality of any part, nor does it detract from the prominence of the Taj Mahal proper.	82.84708246169612

I recently wrote an article on the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World and the Seven Modern Wonders.  Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza.  All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time.  The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq.  The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters.  So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.

Portugese explorers were the first Europeans to see the Harbor, also known as Guanabara Bay, on January 1, 1502.  They thought they had reached the mouth of an immense river and named it Rio de Janeiro, which means River of January.  Landmarks include Sugarloaf Mountain and Corcovado Peak, which is the site of a gigantic statue of Jesus Christ.  Seven Natural Wonders - Northern Lights Northern Lights, also called Aurora Borealis, are nature's fireworks.  This spectacular light show takes place in the northern regions, but can be seen from many parts of the world.  They occur when solar particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere.  The collision energy between the solar particle and the atmospheric gas is emitted as a photon (light particle).  When there are many collisions, you have an aurora - lights that seem to dance across the sky.

327	139_2-19	I like that philosophy. Form should follow function. Is the Taj Mahal an example of Organic Architecture?	MARCO_14_1277270212-6	Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was best exemplified by Fallingwater (1935), which has been called “the best all-time work of American architecture”.  Wright was a leader of the Prairie School movement of architecture and developed the concept of the Usonian home, his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.  His creative period spanned more than 70 years.  Frank Lloyd Wright, Fallingwater, 1936-39: Fallingwater stands as one of Wright’s greatest masterpieces, both for its dynamism and for its integration with the striking natural surroundings.  It serves as a perfect example of his “organic” philosophy, whereby structures were designed in harmony with humanity and its environment.  Wright’s work includes original and innovative examples of many building types, including offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums.  Wright also designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass.  Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe.  His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio.	93.69315022305818

Wright was especially fond of the Martin House design, referring to it for some 50 years as his ""opus"", and calling the complex ""A well-nigh perfect composition"".  Wright kept the Martin site plan tacked to the wall near his drawing board for the next half century.  The main motives and indications were: First – To reduce the number of necessary parts of the house and the separate rooms to a minimum, and make all come together as an enclosed space—so divided that light, air and vista permeated the whole with a sense of unity.  — Frank Lloyd Wright, ""On architecture"".

Reproduced by permission of Archive Photos, Inc. and traditional ideas.  There was, first, the romantic idea of honest  expression: that a building should be faithful in revealing its  materials and structure, as Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc  (1814–1879) had argued, without any classical ornament or fake  surface or structure.  There was, second, the idea that a  building's form should reflect its plan, its functional  arrangement of interior spaces, as Henry Latrobe and Horatio Greenough  had proposed.  There was, third, the belief that each building should  express something new and distinctive in the times (G. W. F. Hegel    [  1770–1831], Gottfried Semper  [  1803–1879]) and  specifically the new technical resources, such as steel skeletons and electric light and elevators, which suggested  skyscrapers and new forms of building (John Wellborn Root).  There was,  fourth, the ambition, even pride, to achieve an art appropriate to a new  nation, an American art, without Continental or English or colonial  dependencies.	84.24357432231773

Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the ""Athens of Jalisco"", owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there.  Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador.  The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers.  By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region.  Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno.  Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated Convenios de Lagos.  The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s.  Recently, Lagos de Moreno has become an important cultural and tourist destination thanks to its rich history and architecture, some of which still stands from the 17th century ."	95.8910870974546

Temperatures are generally high and consistent, and seasons are more aptly characterised by the difference in rainfall than a change in the mercury.  For example, in Lagos, average temperatures barely range from 77°F (25°C) to 82°F (28°C).  June is the season with peak rains, while January hardly sees any by comparison.  In the south of the country, a coastal region that includes Lagos and the oil-rich area of Port Harcourt, it’s incredibly humid, but it rarely gets hotter than 90°F (32°C).  This area is defined by two rainy periods, one short period and one long period.  The long rainy season begins in late February or early March and lasts until July.  The short rainy season starts in September and runs through October, though rains are not nearly as heavy as in the long season.	90.57932477883878

MARCO_37_1107517688-2	Surprisingly, Jollof rice didn’t originate from any of these two noise makers. Ouch!  Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).  The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries.  The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.  A poll done in 2013 revealed that 40% thought Jollof originated from Ghana, 21% thought it originated from Nigeria, while 23% thought Jollof originated from Senegal.  Thank God we know better.

373	140_4-12	Nigerian and Ghanaian Jollof are quite different, aren’t they? What region did Jollof rice originate from?	KILT_4030485-2	"Despite the variations, the dish is ""mutually intelligible"" across the region, and has spread along with the diaspora to become the best known African dish outside the continent..  Based on its name, the origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that was ruled by the Jolof Empire. Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in ""linguistic, historical or political patterns"".  Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of ""blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy"" as well as the religion of Islam.  Marc Dufumier, Emeritus Professor of Agronomy proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice from Southeast Asia."	89.38875852994897

Beyond that, nearly any kind of meat, vegetable, or spice can be added.   The Senegalese version of Jollof rice is a bit different and is called Ceebu Jen.  It is the national dish of Senegal.

Nigerian Jollof Rice The first key difference in Nigerian Jollof is the type of rice grain used.  Nigerian Jollof is made with long grain parboiled rice.  Long grain rice is not native to Nigeria, but imported from Asian countries.  A second difference is the method of cooking.  The grains used in Nigerian Jollof have to be parboiled and washed a second time to remove the starchy content.  Party Jollof rice, is a popular trademark in most Nigerian parties and celebrations.  This dish is legendary for its smoky taste.  This dish is cooked over a fire wood and allowed to burn at the bottom to give it a smoky flavour.  A significant spice used in cooking the Nigerian Jollof is the bay leaf, which also adds to its rich smoky flavour.  Ghanian Jollof Rice Ghanian Jollof is made with basmati rice which is also known as Thai Jasmine rice.  Basmati is a long slender grained rice with a higher starch content than the long grain parboiled rice.  Basmati also has a characteristic aromatic smell.  Like the long grain rice, basmati is not native to Ghana but imported from Asian countries, especially India.  The basmati rice is not parboiled.  Parboiling makes it soggy.	91.4228976117738

380	140_4-16	Sounds yummy! Is there a third Nigerian dish that I need to try?	KILT_4030485-5	Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base.  Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid.  The dish is then served with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc.  In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein, seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice and there are variations of the classic jollof rice; including coconut jollof rice, fisherman jollof rice (made with prawns, periwinkles, crayfish), mixed vegetables jollof rice, and rice and beans.  More economical versions of jollof rice are popularly referred to among Nigerians as “concoction rice,” the preparation of which can involve as little as rice and pepper.

Section::::History.   In 1962, the Nigerian Tourist Association was established, without regulatory authorities.  In 1976, the Supreme Military Council ruling the country issued Decree No. 54 that created the Nigeria Tourism Board, the country’s first tourism regulatory body.    The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation was established in 1992 by Decree No. 81.    The National Council on Commerce and Tourism was also created and entrusted with the coordination of the planning and development of tourism.  The Minister of Commerce and Tourism chaired the council, in which state commissioners for commerce and tourism, representatives of travel agents, hoteliers and catering associations, tour operators, and various airlines were represented.   After the country's transition to civil government, in 1999, the new Constitution limited the regulatory power of the federal government “to tourist traffic alone.”	93.4447694311366

389	140_2-3	How's the tourism sector in Nigeria managed?	MARCO_25_227670877-3	Tourism Tourism is still a sector bringing in some much needed revenue but it hasn’t been a strong point for Nigeria’s economic development. Management and maintenance issues have also plagued some places with historical values and tourism appeal.  Mining Nigeria’s mining sector fell down the global pecking order in 2012 and it hasn’t fully recovered but the private investors interested in exploring the mining sector might just help boost it back provided Reform Policies and Opaque business ethics don’t cripple it off.  Electricity Nigeria’s electricity production hasn’t been much to write home about, since the consumption continues to weigh down production.  Nigeria consumes an estimate of 18 billion Kilowatts and the production is way insufficient to have power supply on a regular.  Services Nigeria ranks 63rd worldwide and fifth in Africa in services output.  Low power generation has crippled the growth of this sector.  Economic growth from services output remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, crime threats and associated need for security counter measures, non-transparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting.  Other sectors have also contributed their tits and bits to economic development in Nigeria but no matter how ridiculously easy it sounds, there needs to be serious policy restructure, transparency in public-private partnership, and a change of mentality and attitude.	88.57510257279864

KILT_28678189-1	Akwa Akpa  Akwa Akpa, known to European colonists as Old Calabar or Duke Town, was an Efik city-state that flourished in the 19th century in what is now southern Nigeria.  Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized.  The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar.   Section::::Origins and society.   The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger–Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.

400	140_1-9	Duke town. I’m intrigued. Tell me more about Duke Town in Calabar.	KILT_28678189-3	Akwa Akpa, also known as Duke Town to the British, became a center of the slave trade, where slaves were exchanged for European goods.  The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbo, although they were not the most populous ethnicity in the area.   Most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English; around 85% of these ships being from Bristol and Liverpool merchants.   Conditions were brutal.   In 1767, six British slaving vessels were lying in the Calabar river at a time when the people of Duke Town and Old Town were feuding.  By prearrangement with the leaders of Duke Town, the leaders of Old Town were invited on board for a conference to settle the dispute, with guarantees of their safety.  They were seized, with some kept as slaves and a few handed over to Duke Town, where they were executed.   Section::::Later history.   The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves.	88.97900661376843

And when, after a month, the vessel came to the Calabar River and steamed through waters crowded with white cranes and pelicans, and past dark mangrove swamps and sand-banks where the crocodiles lay sunning themselves, and islands gay with parrots and monkeys, up to Duke Town, the queer huddle of mud huts amongst the palm trees that was to be her home, she was excited beyond telling.  For at last that wonderful dream of hers, which she had cherished through so many long years, had come true, and so wonderful was it that it seemed to be still only a dream and nothing more.  Clear above the river and the town, like a lighthouse on a cliff, stood the Mission where ""Daddy"" and ""Mammy"" Anderson, two of its famous pioneers, lived, and with them Mary stayed until she [  Pg 26] knew something about the natives and her work.  She felt very happy; she loved the glowing sunshine, the gorgeous sunsets, the white moonlight, the shining river, the flaming blossoms amongst which the humming-birds and butterflies flitted, and all the sights and sounds that were so different from those in Scotland."	88.10777891881662
402	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-4	"With the suppression of the slave trade, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports.  In 1846 a Christian mission was established by the United Presbyterian Church between Duke Town and Henshaw town, with the support of King Eyo.  The mission was headed by Rev. Hope Masterton Waddell with support from Hugh Goldie, who wrote an account of Calabar in his 1890 book ""Calabar and its Mission"".  That year the chiefs requested British protection for Calabar, but the reply from Lord Palmerston, received in 1848, was that it was not necessary or advisable to grant the request.  The British said they would treat the people of Calabar favorably if they would give up their practice of human sacrifice.  At the time, it was common for wives and slaves of an important man to be sacrificed upon his death.   On the death of King Eyamba in 1847, it was proposed that King Eyo become sole ruler, which the British favored.  However, the Duke Town leaders did not agree, and selected Archibong Duke as the new king.  In 1850, both kings agreed to suppress human sacrifice.   British influence continued to grow, as did acceptance of Christianity.  The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884."	90.79009062188923
403	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_39388584-1	Eyo Honesty II  King Eyo Honesty II was the ruler of Creek Town from approximately 1835 to 1858 when he died.  Creek Town was part of the Old Calabar region in the Bight of Biafra.  Old Calabar was a series of towns up the Cross River, which is in the Southeast edge of present-day Nigeria.  Honesty is an example of African agency in the Atlantic Slave Trade because he was a strong, savvy, and intelligent leader who worked with the Europeans instead of against them, which brought about changes that would forever affect the region.   Section::::Early life.   Although his exact date of birth is unknown, Eyo was cited to have been born in 1788 by an epitaph located on a tower of the Creek Town Presbyterian Church.  As a child, Eyo served as a cabin boy to English traders in the Triangle Trade network.  It was during this time that he learned to speak and write the English language.  He also learned the ways of the slave trade and how to do business which would benefit him as a ruler later on in life.  After his father lost the throne, his family fell upon hard times and Eyo found himself in the employment of his father's rival, the Great Duke Ephraim, after his father died in 1820.	86.92279567439255

Apparently, many girls fall for their lies and frauds.  The article ends with the words “ you have been warned.  Stay away from Nigerian men ”.

MARCO_51_664966003-3	"Scammers try to swindle small amounts from huge number of candidates in the name of ""pay to audition"" and ""register to join"" schemes that reap no benefit to the user in the end. Social media platforms are highly exploited by these scammers, in order to create fake ads and opportunities that innocent users fall prey to.  The ads and offers may appear to be so real that the users who are applying for these do not look for legitimacy.  It is always good to be educated about different ways in which scammers approach the users.  The following tips will help you spot and avoid casting call scams.  Top 5 Ways to spot a casting call scam: Casting call without audition Address requests No wire transfers No proper information Prepayment Casting call without audition : Most of the scam companies tend to call the candidate without any audition.  This is the most common way to spot a casting call scam.  They insist the candidate to join immediately without audition.  The scammer thinks that this is the easiest way to trap the candidate, but the user should be aware that no company or agency has such an urgent requirement to select the candidate without even auditioning.  Address requests : Any casting company that insists on address request of the candidate is to be put on doubt."	84.80728343455121

It’s just not how he’s wired.  Remember, guys think showing any kind of weakness (and yes, he thinks sharing his emotions are a weakness) will make you think less of him.  It’s up to you to make him feel comfortable enough to be himself and be open with you.  With the right techniques, you can totally do it – you just need to know how.  1.  Wait until he’s busy with another activity.  Guys panic when you try to get them to talk and they don’t have a distraction nearby.  Guys are far more likely to talk to you if they don’t have to do it face to face.  Try to ask him about his day while he’s working on his car or helping you do the dishes after dinner.  You can even talk to him when he’s doing his favorite hobby.  He’ll more relaxed and feel less cornered that way.  2  . Start with a joke.	72.20486992807128

429	141_2-1	So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?	MARCO_02_420075955-1	Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital.  Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s.  A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time.  The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return.  This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return.  Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme.  How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example.  Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month.  The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month.  The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest.  This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.	90.82624311977996

The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

431	141_2-1	So is this scam that offers 20% monthly interest on my money a Ponzi scheme?	KILT_47185-1	"Ponzi scheme  A Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.  The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.   The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.   The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"".  Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate, and then stole the money that the women had invested.  She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens' 1844 novel ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" and his 1857 novel ""Little Dorrit"" both feature such a scheme."	82.52328952832613

MARCO_55_1041747783-13	Because it can only grow so far, any Ponzi scheme is destined to eventually collapse under its own weight, so the con man usually pulls a disappearing act after collecting enough money, leaving the investors with nothing but the fake returns they received to keep them involved in the swindle. Undoubtedly the most famous recent example involved Bernard Madoff, a New York financier who engineered a Ponzi scheme estimated to be in the neighborhood of $65 billion.  Madoff was eventually caught and sentenced to 150 years in prison, but not before pulling of what is essentially the biggest con game of all time.  Other Articles you Might Like Liked it?

Here are a few Ponzi scheme examples from over the years: Bernie Madoff: Bernie Madoff was an American stockbroker who led the longest running Ponzi scheme to date.  For 30 years, he used this method with stock and securities for his business, the Wall Street firm.  Because of his experience in finance, it was easy for investors to believe what he was saying.  In 2008, Madoff was arrested for his scam and is currently serving a 150-year sentence and required to pay back the $170 billion owed to investors.

435	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_36_840746247-2	A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud whereby crooks steal money from investors and mask the theft by funneling returns to clients from funds contributed by newer investors. Bernard Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a $65 billion scam encompassing thousands of investors that was uncovered in 2008.  Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release.  Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds.  In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.  While it’s too soon to tell if last year’s total was an anomaly, some experts fear it could herald a return to more sinister times.	89.79859414236853
436	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_14_1199417139-2	Ponzi Schemes Ponzi schemes are named after the originator of this particular fraud – Charles Ponzi – who scammed large numbers of investors by promising them a 50% or better return on their investments in postal coupons. However, rather than actually making any investments, Ponzi simply pocketed the investors’ money for himself.  He was able to continue the scam by attracting new investors and using part of their money to pay returns to earlier investors.  In return, the earlier investors would help Ponzi attract new investors by bragging about the amazing returns they were earning with him.  However, ultimately, Ponzi got to the point where he couldn’t attract enough new investors to pay off the growing number of previous investors.  At that point, the scam was discovered, and it fell apart.  Step-by-Step Process – Ponzi Scheme The fraudster attracts an investor by promising them extraordinary returns on investment.  As an example, assume the perpetrator of the Ponzi scheme gets an initial investor to give him $1 million to invest, promising a return of 25% or better.  The fraudster never invests the money received and just takes it for themselves.  They attract a second investor, who also invests $1 million.	89.15860380022787
437	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_01_1705298236-2	As more investors are lured into a Ponzi scheme, still more must be recruited to pay them. When too many new investors are needed to pay existing ones, the money runs out and the fraud is discovered—or, as in Madoff’s case, adverse market movements lead to demands for redemptions that can’t be met, giving the game away.  After his scam was uncovered in late 2008 and Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison, authorities set about recouping his victims’ money.  Rick Antle, the William S. Beinecke Professor of Accounting at Yale SOM and a member of the team engaged in the recovery effort, noted in a conversation with Yale Insights that restitution for victims of any Ponzi scheme comes from two sources: the assets of the perpetrator and the apparent profits of early participants.  “You have to follow the money,” he said, including into “the hands of people who took out more money than they put in.”  Even though it’s “emotionally wrenching,” Antle said, “you have to claw that back and redistribute it to people who actually lost money.”	85.25460118346382
438	141_2-7	No, tell me how Ponzi schemes collapse	MARCO_18_1642035430-8	"Similar schemes A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a mistaken belief in a nonexistent financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish these schemes from Ponzi schemes: In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a ""hub"" for the victims, interacting with all of them directly.  In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly.  Failure to recruit typically means no investment return.  A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, and often attracts well-to-do investors, whereas pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.  A pyramid scheme typically collapses much faster because it requires exponential increases in participants to sustain it.  By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive (at least in the short-term) simply by persuading most existing participants to reinvest their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.  Cryptocurrencies have been employed by scammers attempting a new generation of Ponzi schemes.  For example, misuse of initial coin offerings, or ""ICOs"", on the Ethereum blockchain platform have been one such method, known as "" smart Ponzis "" per the Financial Times."	82.56241444684565
439	141_2-7	No, tell me how Ponzi schemes collapse	MARCO_18_1642035430-9	"The novelty of ICOs means that there is currently a lack of regulatory clarity on the classification of these financial devices, allowing scammers wide leeway to develop Ponzi schemes using these assets. Economic bubbles are also similar to a Ponzi scheme in that one participant gets paid by contributions from a subsequent participant until inevitable collapse.  A bubble involves ever-rising prices in an open market (for example stock, housing, cryptocurrency, tulip bulbs, or the Mississippi Company) where prices rise because buyers bid more, and buyers bid more because prices are rising.  Bubbles are often said to be based on the ""greater fool"" theory.  As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme: In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value.  A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.  Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant."	82.39107055030763

This unique scheme was billed as ""for women only"".  Howe was arrested on October 18, 1880, by New York City Police and sentenced to three years in prison.   BULLET::::- On March 22, 2000, four people were indicted in the Northern District of Ohio, on charges including conspiracy to commit and committing mail and wire fraud.

BULLET::::- In late 2003, a scheme by Bill Hickman, Sr., and his son, Bill Jr., was shut down.

Pyramid Scheme There are many schemes having many similarities with Ponzi schemes but differ on some points.  Pyramid schemes are such schemes that appear legitimate businesses, but are pointed out by FBI as schemes that are fraudulent and ask common people to stay away from those schemes.  A pyramid scheme is so called because of every subsequent level being larger than the previous one.  So the founder sits at the top while new members are added to lower level.  The money that comes from new members goes up the order.  There is no sale of product or service, just like Ponzi schemes, and members at higher levels enjoy the fruits of labor of members in their down line as they remain involved in recruiting new members.  What is the difference between Pyramid Scheme and Ponzi Scheme?  Both Ponzi and Pyramid schemes do not make any profits by selling a thing or a service, but fund older members with money from new members.	72.40218206122518

MARCO_02_407019929-7	Advertisement Ponzi Schemes vs. Pyramid Schemes ­ ­Many people associate Ponzi schemes with pyramid schemes. While they do share some similarities, they're not exactly the same.  If you think about the organization and methodology behind a Ponzi scheme, it certainly has a triangular structure.  The schemer sits at the top, above continually increasing rungs of investors.  However, there are fundamental differences between how classic pyramid schemes are carried out and how Ponzi schemes are executed.  Advertisement The essential difference between a pyramid scheme and a Ponzi scheme is that a Ponzi schemer will only ask you to invest in something.  You won't be asked to take any more action than handing over money.  He or she will claim to take care of the rest and give you your returns later.  The Ponzi schemer is the mastermind behind the whole system and is always shuffling money from one place to another.  On the other hand, a pyramid schemer will offer you an opportunity to make the money yourself.  It requires more work, though: You have to buy the right to start a franchise and start recruiting more people like yourself.  The recruits will often pay the recruiter a cut of their profits.  You can read How Pyramid Schemes Work to understand more about that process.	72.09668394969776

These categories are the Ponzi, the Pyramid, the Direct Sales, and finally the ""pure marketing"" network.  The Ponzi is the classic illegal operation where people are recruited to a fraudulent operation where the money they pay to join is used to pay others who are higher up the tree.  The product here is usually vapour or badly priced or even just bad. Example:- the original Ponzi scheme selling and redeeming international reply postage coupons.  The Pyramid is a price tiered system, where people buy stock from their up-line and sell it at a higher price to their down-line or if they are lucky to a user, the next down-line then has to sell it at an even higher price.... and so on, until the price is so high that no-one will buy it and the holder of the stock is left with an unsaleable mountain.  Other wise this is a moderately standard Direct Sales operation.  Another characteristic is that sales of products are less important to your pocket than recruiting.  These are illegal in many jurisdictions.  There are other characteristics of the pyramid, which vary from country to country as they are legal definitions as opposed to ways of operating."	80.2758863568306

While often confused for each other, pyramid schemes and Ponzi schemes are different from each other.  They are related in the sense that both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are forms of financial fraud.  However, pyramid schemes are based on network marketing, where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money to the top of the pyramid.  They fail simply because there are not sufficient people.  Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of ""Robbing Peter to pay Paul""—early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors.  In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier.  Thus, a scheme such as the Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998) in India can be called a Ponzi scheme."	79.86790508683771

The bubble oscillates between high and low pressure at a high frequency, creating a distinctive and well-quantified sound.  The sound radiates energy, so the bubble eventually reaches equilibrium with its surroundings.     The frequency of the sound is well defined (Minnaert 1993) and depends on bubble radius, local pressure, local water density, and a geophysical constant.  The important observation is that the size of the bubble is inversely proportional to its resonance (ringing) frequency.  Larger bubbles ring at lower frequencies and smaller bubbles ring at higher frequencies.  The sound radiated is often loud and narrowly tuned in frequency (a pure tone).  But quickly, after just tens of milliseconds, a bubble in water becomes a quiet adult bubble and changes its role—it absorbs sound and is especially efficient at absorbing sound at its resonance frequency.  Naturally occurring raindrops range in size from about 300 microns in diameter (a drizzle droplet) to more than 5 millimeters in diameter (often at the beginning of a heavy downpour).  As the drop size changes, the shape of the splash changes and so does the subsequent sound production.  In laboratory and field studies (Medwin et al.	90.81292755711728

This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	86.803671766771

MARCO_39_1259607096-5	Changes in the transportation infrastructure, mainly the  construction of railroads, facilitated the integration into the world  capitalist economy, from which Buenos Aires and other port cities  benefitted greatly. Buenos Aires, the capital, acquired such a dominance  that it led many observers to refer to it and its culture as if it were  the whole country.  The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity.  The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy.  The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires.  A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin.  Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration.  Population and wealth are unequally  distributed.  As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	84.1093614550773

I’m also something of a carnivore and the beef in Buenos Aires and everywhere else in Argentina is not only cheap, but noticeably better than what you get pretty much anywhere else.  Uruguay and Brazil also have fantastic meat and sausages and so forth, not to mention fried cheese.  Those places are also great for varied entertainment.  Speaking at least some Spanish is very helpful in Argentina and Uruguay, but you can get by in mostly English if you have to.  Once you are in Buenos Aires the domestic flights there are pretty cheap so you might also consider checking out the wine country area of Mendoza or the adventure-travel hot spot of Bariloche, and/or the amazing Iguazu Falls waterfall on the border with Brazil and Paraguay.  If that appeals to you then you should buy the plane tickets as soon as possible because every warm destination is popular in those last weeks in December.  Due to their poor economy, Argentina is fairly cheap these days, at least once you get there.	89.5679659154921

Argentine is also the suggested adjective.  In practice, however, I think most people, in the U.S. at least, use Argentinians/Argentineans in speech and in writing.  In more careful writing, you will probably come across Argentine more.  I personally almost never use Argentine.  I do have an American friend living in Buenos Aires, and she constantly says Argentine whenever I speak to her over the phone or online.  To me, I sounded weird at first, and I'm not sure if she's always said Argentine even before moving there.  Also, when using Argentine, I would pronounce the last syllable like ""teen"" and not like ""tahyn"" (long i sound).  The friend I mentioned early says the latter.  I would say that both pronunciations would be common in American English, but the ""een"" pronunciation is much more usual just in other words such as Byzantine or Florentine.  merquiades Senior Member Lorraine (in France)  English (USA Northeast) Nov 7, 2010 #17 Dictionary recommendations aside, I use both Argentine and Argentinian.

The generally accepted theory is that in the mid-1800s, the African slaves who had been brought to Argentina or their descendants began to influence the local culture.  The word “tango” may be straightforwardly African in origin, meaning “closed place” or “reserved ground.”  Or it may derive from Portuguese (and from the Latin verb tanguere, to touch) and was picked up by Africans on the slave ships.  Whatever its origin, the word “tango” had acquired the standard meaning of the place where African slaves and free blacks gathered to dance by the time Argentina banned slavery in 1853.  During the later part of the 1800s and early 1900s, Argentina was undergoing a massive immigration.  In 1869, Buenos Aires had a population of 180,000.  By 1914, its population was 1.5 million.  The intermixing of African, Spanish, Italian, British, Polish, Russian and native-born Argentines resulted in a melting pot of cultures, and each borrowed dance and music from one another.	82.53706583427265

MARCO_13_429898392-1	The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance The tango: Argentina traditions in culture, music and dance Tango is one of the most famous and influential dances in the world.  Originating in Buenos Aires in the 18th century, tango brought together working class European immigrants, indigenous Argentinians and former slaves.  As a result, tango has shaped Argentinian culture and society.  The dance’s popularity meant that it quickly expanded out of Argentina, with several different styles developing in Europe and North America.  With its rich history, tango is a fascinating tradition in dance which reveals a wealth of information about Argentina traditions.  Argentina traditions: The origin of tango The word “tango” or “tambo” appears around the turn of the 19th century to describe music and dance events organized by slaves.  The first official use of the word appears in a statute from 1789, where Argentine authorities banned “tango” gatherings to oppress the working class.  It wasn’t until one hundred years later that the word became commonplace.  The original tango dance was a blend of styles produced by the mix of cultures in the lively port of Buenos Aires.  In the 19th century, thousands of young people arrived from Europe in search of a better life.	81.93184755113907

All sources stress the influence of African communities and their rhythms, while the instruments and techniques brought in by European immigrants in the 20th century played a major role in the style's final definition, relating it to the salon music styles to which tango would contribute back at a later stage.  Angel Villoldo 's 1903 tango "" El Choclo "" was first recorded no later than 1906 in Philadelphia.  Villoldo himself recorded it in Paris (possibly in April 1908, with the Orchestre Tzigane du Restaurant du Rat Mort), as there were no recording studios in Argentina at the time.  Early tango was played by immigrants in Buenos Aires, then later in Montevideo.  The first generation of tango players from Buenos Aires was called ""Guardia Vieja"" (the Old Guard)."	81.75030305655673

Gaucho is the name given to the cowboys of South American countries, which include Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.  Some people in the city areas also wear this costume, but it would be a mistake to assume that all people in Argentina always wear these types of clothes – they do not.  As with most countries, there is an eclectic mix of clothing that people wear on a day to day basis, with people following latest fashions and trends, those who wear classic clothes, and those who prefer to wear traditional outfits, or elements of traditional costumes with more modern touches.  Typical footwear in Argentina includes the alpargatas.  This is a shoe made from canvas with a rope sole.  Sometimes, the sole may be rubber.  This style of shoe comes in a wide variety of different colours and patterns.  They are very sturdy and strong and last well.  These features made these shoes very popular in particular with people who worked outdoors and needed durable footwear.  Men often wear trousers called tje bombachas de campo, although they are unisex and so may also be worn by women.	85.61098926409613

When walking around the streets, it’s common to see locals wearing jeans, t-shirts, dress pants, and blouses.  When going to work, people normally wear more formal clothing, such as slacks and formal shirts, while others wear uniforms.  School children are also required to wear uniforms in class.  Football is very popular in Argentina, so it’s also quite common to see many wear jerseys of their favorite players.  Argentina’s modern culture still clearly shows the influence of its European immigrants, but African and American-Indian influences are also evident in music and art.  Most of the locals hail from countries such as Spain, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Russia, Great Britain, Switzerland, the Middle East, and Poland.  The people are well-educated and are very proud of their country and culture in Argentina.  They are predominantly Catholic due to their Spanish heritage, which is an explanation for why their views on family and social life tend to lean toward conservatism.	78.70104259694926

The museum moved to its current location, a former Nobleza Piccardo tobacconist in the San Telmo neighborhood, in 1986.    Following a five-year, 15 million-dollar renovation, the museum's main building was reopened to the public on December 23, 2010; future expansion plans include an addition that would quadruple its existing 3,000 m² (32,000 ft²) of space, and would absorb the library and archives annex, currently located at 963 Adolfo Alsina Street.

This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	86.803671766771

MARCO_39_1259607096-5	Changes in the transportation infrastructure, mainly the  construction of railroads, facilitated the integration into the world  capitalist economy, from which Buenos Aires and other port cities  benefitted greatly. Buenos Aires, the capital, acquired such a dominance  that it led many observers to refer to it and its culture as if it were  the whole country.  The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity.  The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy.  The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires.  A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin.  Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration.  Population and wealth are unequally  distributed.  As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	84.1093614550773

496	142_6-1	How do I prepare mate?	MARCO_31_815895560-6	How to Prepare Yerba Mate Tea Traditionally, yerba mate tea leaves are brewed in hollowed out gourds and sipped through bombillas, a metal straw with a strainer at the bottom. The gourd is passed around and the water refilled up to 20 times.  The traditional recipe results in a very strong beverage, as the gourd is packed with leaves.  But never fear, gourds not required!  You can make yerba mate at home in a French press, coffee pot, or with a simple household strainer.  Generally, for every 1 cup of water use a heaping 1 teaspoon of ground yerba mate.  To make yerba mate tea in a coffee pot, use 4 TBSP of the leaves for a 12-cup coffee pot and brew as usual.  If using a French press, add yerba mate tea to the press, then pour very hot but not boiling water over it.  Let this steep for 3-8 minutes, depending on preference.  If using a strainer, add the yerba mate to a pot of very hot water, cover, and let steep for 3-8 minutes.  Use a fine mesh strainer to filter out the leaves and pour into a cup.  Yerba mate tea can be enjoyed with a little raw cream or milk.	77.18105772696435
497	142_6-1	How do I prepare mate?	MARCO_49_111015780-6	Each country has its regional variation on the drink, thereby resulting in each country preferring one “style” of yerba mate preparation that is very distinct from the other. Argentina Despite being the largest supplier of yerba mate in the world, Argentina still likes to keep things traditional.  The country prefers their yerba with a medium leaf cut, with stems intact.  The tea is often served in a traditional small gourd and a bombilla (metal straw).  Uruguay Uruguayans like their yerba mate strong.  They brew the tea for longer in larger gourds, and the tea itself must have a small leaf cut, with no stems.  Paraguay Unlike its neighbors who love their hot teas, Paraguay serves yerba mate cold.  The tea, which is similar to the Argentinian style- with stems intact- can be served in a guampa mate (bulls horn) mug with a bombilla.  Yerba mate flavors differ in many ways.  From fruit or herbal blends, that can be bought, or you can try to do it yourself and also, from country to country.  The best way to find a taste that will suit you is to try as many versions possible and catch that taste that you will really enjoy. .	75.39861205359921

MARCO_29_808534484-1	The History and Legend of Yerba Mate - Tea Perspective The History and Legend of Yerba Mate Updated: April, 21, 2021 The Yerba Mate tree is found in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina.  The dried leaves of the tree are used to make the quintessentialSouth American tea: Yerba Mate.  This tea has a flavour profile comparable to green tea, but is much stronger; many people find it takes time to acquire a taste for it.  Even more interesting than the tea itself, are the history and legends surrounding the tea.  The first people who drank Yerba Mate are the indigenous forest people of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.  They called it the “Drink of the Gods,” and believed it significantly improved their stamina and overall health.  When the Spanish colonizers arrived in Argentina and conquered the Guarani tribes, the Conquistadors were struck by the robust stature and extreme stamina of the locals.  The Guarani told the Spaniards the secret is the tea they drink every day.  According to their beliefs, they explained, a god had given the Yerba Mate tree (whose leaves are used for the drink) as a reward to their ancestors for righteous behaviour.	74.98642288753763

Mate is an extremely popular beverage in Argentina.  Made from a bitter herb, called yerba mate, the drink has an extensive history and a wealth of rituals and customs surrounding its consumption.  Most foreigners find mate bitter, perhaps even unsavory, but Argentines adore it.  I had my first experience with mate at Vamos Spanish Academy.  The school hosted an after-class workshop on the beverage, and I was given the opportunity to try it with an Argentine host and a group of international classmates.  Our host explained the traditions surrounding the drink and gave us a lesson on how to properly enjoy the experience.

Section::::History.   Mate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people who lived in that part of southern Brazil and northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War.  Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is ""Ilex paraguariensis"".  The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival.  Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata and from there to Chile.  This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef.  Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands."	70.83775310893543

I hope you brought your appetite, let’s get started.  Pizza & Faina While Argentina was settled largely by Italian immigrants, the pizza tastes nothing like a thin Neapolitan pie.  If you want to try proper Porteño pizza, skip the takeout and head to Avenida Corrientes.  The street comes to life at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square, lined with theaters and neon lights.  The crust is thick, light on the sauce and HEAVY on the cheese.  Sit and order a whole pie or order a slice to eat standing at the bar.  The best wine pairing is poured from a box by a grumpy old man.  If you really want to sound like a local, order a slice of fainâ to go with it.  Faina is a chickpea pancake or pie, placed on top of the pizza, it’s a little too starch on starch for my taste but it’s not bad!

Fruits and Vegetables in Chile Chile's temperate central region is ideally situated for growing fruits and vegetables, and fresh produce is abundant in this region and in Chile's large cities.

518	142_1-3	What makes Buenos Aires the culture capital of South America?	KILT_255919-1	"Buenos Aires  Buenos Aires ( or ; ) is the capital and largest city of Argentina.  The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast.  ""Buenos Aires"" can be translated as ""fair winds"" or ""good airs"", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name ""Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre"".  The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6 million.   The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district.  In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.  The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city.  The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (""Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires""; ""CABA"")."	87.55937585583888

MARCO_25_937745370-10	Old World European customs mix with New World Latin American traditions to form a cultural heritage unique to Argentina. This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

There are many cinemas and galleries in major urban centers which are popular with richer, elite members of society and visiting them is regarded as something of a status symbol.  However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	86.803671766771

MARCO_39_1259607096-5	Changes in the transportation infrastructure, mainly the  construction of railroads, facilitated the integration into the world  capitalist economy, from which Buenos Aires and other port cities  benefitted greatly. Buenos Aires, the capital, acquired such a dominance  that it led many observers to refer to it and its culture as if it were  the whole country.  The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity.  The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy.  The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires.  A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin.  Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration.  Population and wealth are unequally  distributed.  As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	84.1093614550773

KILT_67340-46	The unique condition of Argentina, as a country which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina.   According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier.  Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.   Duncan and Fogarty (1984) argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina.  According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia's, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.	78.6599664496025

Since independence from Spain in 1816, the country has defaulted on its debt nine times and inflation has often been in the double digits, even as high as 5000%, resulting in several large currency devaluations .  Argentina possesses definite comparative advantages in agriculture, as the country is endowed with a vast amount of highly fertile land.  Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth.  During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income.  By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest state per capita.  Beginning in the 1930s, however, the Argentine economy deteriorated notably.  The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government."	75.96231314603938

History of the Capital of Argentina Present-day Buenos Aires was inhabited by indigenous peoples until Spanish explorers founded the city in 1536.  The native inhabitants defended their homes and forced the European settlers out of the region by 1542.  Nearly 40 years later, Spanish colonizers returned and established a trading post.  Traders of the time, however, were penalized by the complexity of the approved trading routes (which benefitted Lima, Peru) and by the later part of the 19th century, began to promote the idea of independence from the Spanish crown.	84.38643004652113

I hope you brought your appetite, let’s get started.  Pizza & Faina While Argentina was settled largely by Italian immigrants, the pizza tastes nothing like a thin Neapolitan pie.  If you want to try proper Porteño pizza, skip the takeout and head to Avenida Corrientes.  The street comes to life at night, reminiscent of New York’s Times Square, lined with theaters and neon lights.  The crust is thick, light on the sauce and HEAVY on the cheese.  Sit and order a whole pie or order a slice to eat standing at the bar.  The best wine pairing is poured from a box by a grumpy old man.  If you really want to sound like a local, order a slice of fainâ to go with it.  Faina is a chickpea pancake or pie, placed on top of the pizza, it’s a little too starch on starch for my taste but it’s not bad!

MARCO_10_1345225280-2	Most American versions of whipped cream add both sugar and vanilla to the cream, which is essentially the same thing. This cream is credited to the chef Francois Vatel.  At the Chateau de Chantilly, Vatel supervised a huge banquet for Louis XIV and a reported 2,000 guests, where he created the now famous cream for use in pastries.  Sadly, Vatel would not be able to enjoy the cream's later popularity; his despair over the slow cooking of the fish resulted in him committing suicide later that night.  Most Americans know Chantilly cream as whipped cream.  The creation of Chantilly cream is thus tainted by Vatel’s suicide.  Yet few remember its origins, or if they do, prepare the cream because of its popularity, and as a way to honor the terribly misguided genius of Vatel.  Today, it is used throughout Europe in various pastries like eclairs, cream puffs, and it also may top ice cream.  In the US, Chantilly cream is relatively standard.  American cooks may also use the cream in French or Italian inspired pastries, or to top, fill, or frost numerous types of cakes.  The Fruit Basket cake, a golden cake, is layered with fruit and cream, and generally also frosted with the whipped cream.	91.58875523802816

Don’t expect police to stop you driving through a red light, or give you a fine for riding your bike on the pavement.  There are no security cameras around the cities like in London, and rules exist in theory only.  There is a great freedom in Argentina that has been lost in much of the rest of the world, but of course this also comes with its drawbacks, in that often the country doesn’t run very efficiently.  But nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice!  Many people come to Argentina and stay because of the great climate.  Winters are mild, with temperatures rarely falling below about 5 degrees celsius, and summers are hot and lengthy.  There is also something very satisfying about spending summer in the southern hemisphere when everyone in the northern hemisphere is having to struggle through January!

MARCO_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners. In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real.  This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers.  Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell.  All this led to a sharp reduction in exports.  As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998.  Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy.  In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket.  Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime.  As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	90.92185188599252

WAPO_XWC7DVRLCUI6TMAR3BIAMRG4TA-3	Here’s Argentina’s secret: Every additional 100 meters (about 328 feet) of altitude decreases the average temperature by 1 degree Celsius. That means grapes with higher acidity and softer tannins.  But the intensity of the sunlight increases as well, allowing the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness while the cooler temperatures keep the sugars in check.  The combination of low temperatures and high-intensity sun yields red wines of high intensity and extraction, soft and almost imperceptible tannins, and impressive structure and balance.  Altitude is only one factor in Argentina’s reach for quality.  “Our wines are wines of the sun, but also of the soil,” says Sebastian Zuccardi, third-generation winemaker at Familia Zuccardi in Mendoza.  He is also in charge of winemaking at his family’s Santa Julia winery.  It would be easy to say the Zuccardi wines emphasize quality, while the Santa Julia label offers value, but that would be oversimplifying it.  Both lines offer value and quality.  The Zuccardi family built a new winery a few years ago in the Paraje Altamira area of the Uco Valley, about a 90-minute drive south of Mendoza.  Zuccardi uses concrete tanks for fermenting and aging his red wines, believing that way he can produce malbec that is most expressive of its terroir.	90.61238449443044

Other grape varieties which perhaps hold the most promise for Argentina's future are Bonarda and Torrontés.   Section::::History.   Argentina's wine route is still relatively new.  Although the country’s wine production dates back to the 16th century, the inclination of growth for consumption was essentially based on volume and not quality, so there was little significance placed on the art of planting vine varieties best suited to each location and its ecosystem.  Argentina’s wine industry was transformed in the 1990s when international investors had the foresight to recognize the value and untapped resource of Argentina's wine producing potential.  It has been estimated that over $1.5 billion in new vineyard investment occurred in the following decade, designed to strengthen and improve the industry's production quality.  Argentina wine regions have since undergone a radical transformation, and now rival the production quality of European wine-producing countries.    The concept of creating tourism oriented enterprises has taken form over the past decade.  Renowned architects are translating brand identity into built structures, and now numerous iconic wineries dot the landscape of Argentina’s wine regions.	87.06721915243543

Open banking is a concept in financial services based on several principles: the use of open APIs allowing third party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions, increased financial transparency options for account holders and the use of open source technology to achieve these principles.  Using APIs means that banking data will be available in real-time, providing consumers with better ways to conduct transactions, save and invest their money.  Consumers may also have access to better loan terms since lenders will be able to look at historical transactional data to determine a borrower’s risk level.  Open Banking also aims to give consumers better and more personalized information for making sound financial decisions.  Around the world there are pressures, both regulatory and customer-led, that are opening up the financial services market to new entrants and disrupting what and how customers buy.  In Europe, the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is set to unleash a transformation in how financial services organizations view themselves and each other.  In the United States, aggregators such as Mint.com have already dis-intermediated banks and now own the ‘last mile’ of the customer banking relationship, disrupting traditional players.	89.48392714560032

Technology creates room for new approaches and solutions that could not previously exist.  Regulation champions ‘Open’ as an explicit policy goal, with directives like PSD2 aiming to create growth via choice, transparency and competition.  The market opportunity in the deposits business Prior to Deposit Solutions there was no open platform allowing banks to offer attractive third party deposit products to their own customers through their existing accounts.  Instead customers who wanted a choice of deposit products were forced to laboriously open additional accounts elsewhere.  Meanwhile, banks requiring additional funding for strategic or regulatory aims were unable to access this deposit market without operating their own expensive retail infrastructure in each country.  What was missing was an efficient transmission mechanism to match supply and demand.  It was this need that inspired the creation of Deposit Solutions in 2011.  Our team saw that it was time to reinvent the deposit business in Europe through building a true Open Banking solution for this EUR 17+ trillion market with the help of open technology.	96.8071655044526

Lower operational costs.  Another benefit is cutting operational costs, as banks can spend less time supporting foreign subsidiaries providing some services directly from the home market.  Higher competition.  Customers will benefit from increased competition in the financial industry as prices will go down and service quality will go up.  For example, customers will be able to use financial services aggregators to compare offers from banks and other institutions.  They’ll also get remote access to a number of products that used to be available in branches only.  Added value from third parties.  Third parties can access banking data, allowing them to design new products, innovate, and create additional value for bank customers.  As trust in non-bank payment providers grows, open banking provides such companies with a number of opportunities in the financial services market.

While the open banking model in the United States may take a different path, US banks can learn valuable lessons by looking at how it has been implemented in more regulatory-driven environments.  Bank leaders may find it particularly helpful to review how different regions set technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing.  To date, there are no signs that new open banking regulations are being developed in the United States.  In 2018, the US Treasury Department stated that there are significant differences between the United Kingdom and the United States, “with respect to the size, nature, and diversity of the financial services sector and regulatory mandates,” and as such, “an equivalent open banking regime for the US market is not readily applicable.”  12 This implies that the US banking industry is likely to pursue an industry-driven approach.  However, policymakers and regulators have issued recommendations encouraging banks to adopt best practices.  Banks, large and small, are developing APIs to facilitate a safe means to exchange banking data and move away from less secure, screen-scraping methods.	96.8345784332605
562	143_1-5	Does Open Banking exist in the United States?	MARCO_59_690617273-3	Here are some key factors US bank leaders can consider when developing their open banking approaches. Key messages In the United States, open banking is expected to evolve as an industry-driven initiative, unlike other countries, where regulatory mandates are forcing many banks to adopt open banking.  However, US banks can benefit from lessons learned in these regions, such as how to establish technical and customer experience standards for data-sharing/APIs.  If done well, open banking can help US banks achieve key strategic goals.  Open banking can amplify and accelerate banks’ digital transformation efforts and the emergence of new business models.  So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.  The question, “Who owns my data?” is at the heart of how receptive consumers may be about open banking.	94.08813458141049

564	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_44_737771076-2	Understanding Open Banking Under open banking, banks allow access and control of customers personal and financial data to third-party service providers, which are typically tech startups and online financial service vendors. Customers are normally required to grant some kind of consent to let the bank allow such access, such as checking a box on a terms-of-service screen in an online app.  Third-party providers APIs can then use the customer's shared data (and data about the customer's financial counterparties).  Uses might include comparing the customer's accounts and transaction history to a range of financial service options, aggregating data across participating financial institutions and customers to create marketing profiles, or making new transactions and account changes on the customer's behalf.  The Promise of Open Banking Open banking is a driving force of innovation in the banking industry.  By relying on networks instead of centralization, open banking can help financial services customers to securely share their financial data with other financial institutions.  For example, open banking APIs can facilitate the sometimes onerous process of switching from using one bank's checking account service to another bank's.	80.60822310432559
565	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_29_1536976345-9	Open banking presents opportunities for creating and distributing a wide variety of both financial and non-financial products and services – with the banking retaining the customer relationship – but greatly expanding the number and variety of services to improve the customer’s quality of life. In an open banking model, an unlimited number of partners could insert themselves into the relationship development process.  Both fintech firms and banks see the traditional bank continuing to be the primary channel for banking services.  The question is whether banks are the best to control innovation or even distribution.  While neither banks or fintech firms see banks as aggregators of services, this should be a concern as large tech firms are continuing to encroach on the aggregation role.  Losing control of the customer experience could lead to the loss of the customer.  “Perhaps the greatest risk of open banking is that it will allow consumers and merchants to execute direct transactions without going through banks, making it more difficult for banks to have a full view of the customer transactions and maintain customer relationships,” states the WRBR.  It is hoped that the open banking concept can avoid this demise, as traditional banks and fintech firms work together to build the customer’s trust and offer products and services that will improve a consumer’s lifestyle.	76.55431357584894

MARCO_36_839237348-5	“Open Banking will drive more innovation that is good for customers and the financial system— and provide a secure an regulated environment,” Mills told CNBC. “This direction is urgently needed.”  Dutch multinational bank ING was among those that were forced to adapt to the new laws.  Benoit Legrand, chief innovation officer at ING and CEO of ING Ventures, told CNBC there has been a power shift from big institutions “which are no longer respected, for good or bad reasons,” to the hands of the consumers.  “Banks in Europe have generally been pushing back a lot because it’s making their markets more open, and it’s just disrupting the way they have been doing business,” he said.  “We believe firmly in being on the side of the customer for the long run, and being transparent and fair — the money is the customers’, not ours.”  Eventually, Legrand said a move towards more open banking is a good move for consumers and the global economy in general by making it easier to “move money from left to right.”  “It puts pressure on the banks to increase the level of services,” he said.	76.47456325171515

Some individuals have the habit of referring to any variety of cola as “Coke.”  We sometimes refer to the United States as “America” even when we’re aware that America is made up of several different countries.

The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which adds to the market uncertainty.  Investing everything in a single cryptocurrency is a very bad idea, because a better version really could replace bitcoin at the top of the heap.  I'm not saying that this will happen but the risk is not zero percent.  If you're investing in cryptocurrencies today, it's probably best to divide your holdings between bitcoin and a few other respectable names such as Ethereum and Litecoin.  All the major names happen to be falling today, but their performance can vary widely from time to time.  Don't cry for the bitcoin specialists, though.  With the exception of the micro-cap Ebang International, all of them have performed extremely well during the current bitcoin boom.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust gained 347% over the last 52 weeks and MicroStrategy rose 331% over the same period.  CleanSpark's stock posted a 614% gain.

On December 4, 2017, The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that the U.K. Treasury and the EU both had made plans aimed at ending anonymity for cryptocurrency traders, citing anti-money laundering and tax evasion crackdowns.  The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions.  Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.”  The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [  cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”  While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	87.32710559549741

In 2015, a corruption scandal began to engulf Malaysia, involving a government super fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad which was chaired by Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak.  There were a series of exposes by online investigative blogs, namely Sarawak Report and major news portal Wall Street Journal that money was being siphoned off from the fund into personal accounts of Najib and his close relations.  A Public Accounts Committee compromising government and opposition members of parliament was set up to investigate if there were major wrongdoings on the part of Najib and 1MDB.  However, in July, the government began to stifle news reports regarding the 1MDB scandal by blocking the website Sarawak Report, which had been in forefront of exposes revealing the losses incurred by 1MDB and its connection to Najib, from the Malaysian internet community.

It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch.  The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets.  Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing.  However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult.  The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.  Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage.

SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board.  Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking.  Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though.

It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.  The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle, the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched (behind the Saturn V and Energia).   SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).  The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, as a dummy payload.  The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth.   The Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, although , Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.

588	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.

591	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_26_1067160456-2	While the first stage of this rocket is reusable, the upper stage is not. Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it’s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX’s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4).	92.28349835512928
592	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_01_686831562-18	76] Technical feasibility Prior to the reusability program's success in December 2015, the return of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished, and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility. And even after this success, the rapid reuse of a rocket has not been attempted.  Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.  [  6  ]  [  77] Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.  [  78] Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return, vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin.  A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an expendable configuration.  Although the reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets [  28] it is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation.	88.01556970964884
593	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_23_1123984842-4	Reusability – Rockets are designed to have two or three “stages”. The first stage is the actual rocket.  The rocket detaches itself from the rest of the ship and doesn’t actually make it to orbit.  The problem is most rockets are only designed for single-use.  Once it does its job of propelling the payload into orbit, it becomes a very expensive, gigantic tin can.  Very few parts of the rocket are salvaged and reused for the next launch.  Reusable rockets will help reduce costs of space launches significantly but they are complex to build and design so it might take a while to perfect them.  SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is the first system that has managed to have a reusable first-stage.  Development cost – There’s little room for error when it comes to launching things into space.  One small error will put lives and millions of dollars in expensive equipment in danger.  More importantly, human lives.  Designing and building rockets is a big challenge and one that must not be taken lightly.  This is why thousands and thousands of hours have to go into developing the technology and materials that make space travel possible.  Then, all that needs to be tested and re-tested many times on the ground.	81.84728168573929

It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch.  The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets.  Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing.  However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult.  The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.  Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage.  Falcon Heavy at the Cape pic.twitter.com/hizfDVsU7X — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2017 Based on Musk’s photos, all the rocket is missing is the payload.  SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board.  Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking.  Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though.  The Falcon heavy launch is currently scheduled for some time in January, which is not an optimal Mars transfer timeframe, by the way.	82.91757936030626

KILT_31406060-1	Falcon Heavy  The Falcon Heavy is a partially reusable heavy-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured by SpaceX. It is derived from the Falcon 9 vehicle and consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 first stage as the center core with two additional first stages as strap-on boosters.  The Falcon Heavy has the highest payload capacity of any currently operational launch vehicle, the second-highest capacity of any rocket ever to reach orbit, trailing the Saturn V, and the third-highest capacity of any orbital-class rocket ever launched (behind the Saturn V and Energia).   SpaceX conducted the Falcon Heavy's maiden launch on February 6, 2018, at 3:45 p.m. EST (20:45 UTC).  The rocket carried a Tesla Roadster belonging to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, as a dummy payload.  The second Falcon Heavy launch occurred on April 11, 2019 and all three booster rockets successfully returned to earth.   The Falcon Heavy was designed to carry humans into space beyond low Earth orbit, although , Musk does not plan to apply for a human-rating certification to carry NASA astronauts.  The Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9 will be replaced by the Starship and Super Heavy launch system.   Section::::History.

597	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.  Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	85.31789005664177

The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.

603	144_2-3	Tell me more about the rocket engines for Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Dragon, and Starship.	MARCO_50_1715454007-2	Merlin uses chilled RP-1 (which stands for “Rocket Propellant 1” and is basically kerosene) with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. The various Dragon capsules use the “ Draco ” and “ SuperDraco ” engines.  The Draco’s use a “hypergolic” fuel which means that you mix two chemicals and they spontaneously combust - without needing any kind of ignition source.  Both rockets use monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.  When they fire, the exhaust is a very characteristic bright orange.  The StarShip and SuperHeavy use the “Raptor” engines.  Raptor uses liquid Methane (LCH4) as the fuel with liquid Oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer (this is sometimes called “Methalox”).  WHY SWITCH TO METHANE?  The switch from RP-1 to Methane comes about because SpaceX want to fly StarShip to Mars - and if they do that, there won’t be enough room on board to store enough fuel to get home again.  The nice thing about Methane is that it can be made from CO2 and Hydrogen - plus a good supply of electricity.  The atmosphere on Mars is almost all CO2, and hydrogen may be obtained by the electrolysis of water - which is fairly plentiful as ice below the surface of Mars.	89.52163138985634

MARCO_01_485275176-19	Rocket engines Main article: SpaceX rocket engines The Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines — Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor for use in launch vehicles, Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft, and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon .  Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants in a gas-generator power cycle.  Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage, and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.  The Merlin engine uses a pintle injector that provides deep-throttle capability used during Falcon 9 landings.  Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump .  Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine.  It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump, and is fed only by tank pressure.  The engine is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, and is radiatively cooled on the exhaust nozzle.  The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.	75.64994545932859
606	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	89.98173315799795
607	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067150539-6	Because of all these reasons, SpaceX chose rocket grade Kerosene for their Falcon rockets. Drawbacks of Kerosene (RP-1) Propellant: Kerosene produces soot, coking, and polymerization inside the Merlin engine.  As a result, after each rocket launch, SpaceX needs to clean its rocket engine thoroughly.  This process is costly and prevents SpaceX from reusing their rocket in rapid succession.  Though Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy’s Merlin engine uses liquid Kerosene, the Starship’s Raptor engine uses liquid Methane (CH4) as fuel.  Methane burns cleanly and far superior fuel for reusable rockets.  Nowadays, liquid Methane (CH4) is a commonly used rocket propellant.  However, it was not as prevalent before 2007.  SpaceX is building the Starship to send payload and humans to Mars.  Though there is no Methane on Mars, we can manufacture Methane via the Sabatier process.  In this process, we need to mix Carbon Dioxide (CO2) with Hydrogen (H) and then heat the mixture to produce Methane (CH4) and Water (H2O.)  The Martian atmosphere is an abundant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and has water in the ground.  SpaceX can produce Hydrogen from Martian water.  On other planets in our solar system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all have Methane in their atmosphere.	79.66543782874942

MARCO_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel.  However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant.  So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene?  SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines.  And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature.  It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).  It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets.  When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars.  However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable.  So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	76.42745404876769
609	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	90.3329146328615
610	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-5	It’s melting point is -259°C or -435°F, and its boiling point is -252°C or -423°F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.	84.46080970927142
611	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	KILT_27883135-25	Also, although not duct engines, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines have seen extensive use.  However, in almost every other way, hydrogen is problematic.  The downside of hydrogen is its density; in gaseous form the tanks are impractical for flight, but even in the form of liquid hydrogen it has a density one fourteenth that of water.  It is also deeply cryogenic and requires very significant insulation that precludes it being stored in wings.  The overall vehicle would end up being very large, and difficult for most airports to accommodate.  Finally, pure hydrogen is not found in nature, and must be manufactured either via steam reforming or expensive electrolysis.  A few experimental hydrogen-powered aircraft have flown with propellers, and jets have been proposed that may be feasible.   Section::::Advanced designs.:Precooled jet engines.   An idea originated by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 is that hydrogen-fueled engines could theoretically have much higher performance than hydrocarbon-fueled engines if a heat exchanger were used to cool the incoming air.  The low temperature allows lighter materials to be used, a higher mass-flow through the engines, and permits combustors to inject more fuel without overheating the engine.	81.86082010203972
612	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	KILT_58673-3	In most rocket engines fueled by liquid hydrogen, it first cools the nozzle and other parts before being mixed with the oxidizer — usually liquid oxygen (LOX) — and burned to produce water with traces of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Practical H–O rocket engines run fuel-rich so that the exhaust contains some unburned hydrogen.  This reduces combustion chamber and nozzle erosion.  It also reduces the molecular weight of the exhaust, which can actually increase specific impulse, despite the incomplete combustion.   Liquid hydrogen can be used as the fuel for an internal combustion engine or fuel cell.  Various submarines (Type 212 submarine, Type 214 submarine) and concept hydrogen vehicles have been built using this form of hydrogen (see DeepC, BMW H2R).  Due to its similarity, builders can sometimes modify and share equipment with systems designed for liquefied natural gas (LNG).  However, because of the lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large.  Unless direct injection is used, a severe gas-displacement effect also hampers maximum breathing and increases pumping losses.   Liquid hydrogen is also used to cool neutrons to be used in neutron scattering.  Since neutrons and hydrogen nuclei have similar masses, kinetic energy exchange per interaction is maximum (elastic collision).	86.81945331394672

(with pictures)  Join the Community Subscribe to our newsletter and learn something new every day.  Eugene P. Last Modified Date: February 11, 2021 Eugene P. Date: February 11, 2021 Hydrogen is one of the primary propellants of a hydrogen rocket.  A hydrogen rocket is a vehicle that uses hydrogen and oxygen as its primary propellant.  By mixing the two gases and then igniting them, a reaction takes place that causes the release of a great amount of energy.  This energy can launch a vehicle upward and, if large enough, into space.  The widespread use of hydrogen rockets in the space industry over the years can be attributed to the fact that it uses one of the most efficient combustion reactions that can be created for propulsion.  Russia has used concentrated hydrogen peroxide to propel its rockets for decades.  The concept behind how and why a hydrogen rocket works has to do with the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen.  When hydrogen is exposed to an ignition source, it will not ignite unless there also is a specific amount of oxygen present.  A hydrogen rocket mixes hydrogen and oxygen in the correct ratio in a combustion chamber and then ignites the mixture, directing the force behind the rocket to make it move.	83.25797156896442
614	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_09_217844436-3	Rockets Since hydrogen is highly flammable, especially when mixed with pure oxygen, it is used as a fuel in rockets. Usually, they combine liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen to make an explosive mixture.  Unfortunately, in 1986, the U.S. Space Shuttle Challenger exploded when a flame accidentally ignited the liquid hydrogen in an external fuel tank.  This again showed that the gas can be dangerous and cause a disaster in some situations.  Clean fuel for cars But also, hydrogen is one of the cleanest fuels because when it burns, the result is simple water.  That is why there are efforts to create engines that can power automobiles on hydrogen.  This would greatly help to reduce the air pollution and global warming problems.  Although hydrogen is highly flammable, so also is gasoline.  Although care must be taken, the amount of hydrogen used in an automobile would present no more of a hazard than the amount of gasoline used.  One problem with using hydrogen to directly power an automobile is that it is very expensive to create pure hydrogen for this use.  Also, the most common method to create hydrogen for use in cars is with methane ( CH4) gas.  Although burning the hydrogen is pollution-free, methane is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect of global warming.	77.8523936746642

KILT_37724098-1	SpaceX rocket engines  Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed four families of rocket engines — Merlin, Kestrel, Draco and SuperDraco — and is currently developing another rocket engine: Raptor.   Section::::History.   In the first ten years of SpaceX, the company developed a variety of liquid-propellant rocket engines, with at least one more of that type under development.   , each of the engines developed to date—Kestrel, Merlin 1, Draco and Super Draco—had been developed for initial use in the SpaceX Falcon family of launch vehicles—Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy—or for the Dragon capsule.  Each main engine developed by 2012 has been Kerosene-based, using RP-1 as the fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer, while the RCS control thruster engines have used storable hypergolic propellants.   In November 2012, at a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, United Kingdom, SpaceX announced that they plan to develop methane-based engines for their future rockets.  These engines will use staged cycle combustion, for higher efficiency similar to the system used on the former Soviet Union's NK-33 engine.   By mid-2015, SpaceX had developed a total of 9 rocket engines architectures in the first 13 years of the company's existence.	87.88852872070856

617	144_2-11	Tell me about the different types of rocket engines.	MARCO_12_586299903-22	As of October 2012, SpaceX developed several types of rocket engines: Kestrel, Merlin 1, Draco and Super Draco without any support from the government. The last one was developed for the use in the Falcon family of launch vehicles, which are Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy, and for the use in the Dragon spacecraft.  However, Elon Musk does not want to rush with IPO this time.  According to Elon Musk, all the achievements of SpaceX is a background for his biggest dream – an expedition to Mars.  SpaceX is in designing process of Mars Colonial Transporter.  Also, Musk’s engineers work on innovative rocket engines (Grasshopper and the Falcon 9 rockets) and Red Dragon spacecraft that using Falcon Heavy rockets (modified version of Dragon capsule) to transport people from Earth to Mars.  He once said, “I would like to die on Mars, just not on impact.”  Falcon Heavy rocket flight animation: Grasshopper and Falcon 9 are experimental launch vehicles that are able to make vertical landings and vertical takeoffs.  On January 10, 2015, the first attempt to land the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Earth after the launch failed – it landed too roughly.	84.23352886503562

MARCO_17_3580319373-22	A number of tradeoffs arise from this selection, some of which include: Tradeoff comparison among popular engine cycles  Cycle type Gas generator Expander cycle Staged-combustion Pressure-fed Advantages Simple; low dry mass; allows for high power turbopumps for high thrust High specific impulse; fairly low complexity High specific impulse; high combustion chamber pressures allowing for high thrust Simple; no turbopumps; low dry mass; high specific impulse Disadvantages Lower specific impulse Must use cryogenic fuel; heat transfer to the fuel limits available power to the turbine and thus engine thrust Greatly increased complexity &, therefore, mass (more-so for full-flow) Tank pressure limits combustion chamber pressure and thrust; heavy tanks and associated pressurization hardware Cooling Main article: Rocket engine cooling Injectors are commonly laid out so that a fuel-rich layer is created at the combustion chamber wall.  This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ISP and better system performance.  A liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling, which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle.	95.41566862145557

623	144_2-15	What are the tradeoffs between Pressure-Fed, Electric Pump-Fed, Open Cycle, and closed cycle Rocket engines?	MARCO_49_1275677936-9	It's a tradeoff. You can get away with smaller propellant tanks with ion engines, but you need a dense, high power source of electricity.  You can get a lot more thrust for a given energy input with electrothermal or chemical engines, but you need much bigger propellant tanks.  A photon rocket would be the most mass efficient, least energy efficient option...no propellant needed, but enormous amounts of power required to produce any useful thrust.  Photon sails use an external source of light so they don't have to carry around a massive power source and insanely bright light source, instead carrying a lightweight reflective sail, and are rather more practical than photon rockets.  They may use sunlight, but will also work with laser beams that could be produced electrically at a fixed installation.  Jul 7, 2010 #19 Lsos 803 9 I was wondering about the whole photon rocket concept...if matter/antimatter annihilation produces pure energy, wouldn't it be more practical to simply annihilate matter/antimatter (or even detonate a nuclear bomb) inside some sort of mirror-lined combustion chamber, instead of going through the whole nuclear reaction-electricity-preposterously bright flashlight process?	86.26330447656801
624	144_2-17	Why do open cycle rocket engines exhaust fuel?	MARCO_19_1767990244-25	Due to the laws of thermodynamics, as air is compressed, it is heated up. The air in the bow shock compresses so much it actually turns into a plasma.  This plasma can be about half as hot as the surface of the Sun.  Superheavy Bowshock So in order to avoid having this burning hot plasma destroy the rocket, the Falcon 9 will again light up 3 of its 9 Merlin engines to slow itself down just as it begins to really experience those extreme atmospheric temperatures.  This not only slows the booster down, but it also basically creates a “force field” in front of the booster, providing a boundary of exhaust gas which is a lot cooler than the plasma.  Without this step, the Falcon 9 booster would likely not survive the reentry process.  Parachute recovery attempts After all, SpaceX tried to recover the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 boosters using parachutes for the first few flights, which kept failing, likely due to a complete lack of additional heat shielding.  By the time the booster was supposed to deploy the parachutes it was too late.  Because it is hard to deploy parachutes when you are in a million flaming pieces.  But again as we mentioned before, this is something that stainless steel should allow the SuperHeavy booster to forgo which will save fuel and thereby increase overall performance.	90.15796954580584

In response to the anomaly, NASA and SpaceX jointly formed the CRS-1 Post-Flight Investigation Board.  Preliminary information from the post-flight review board indicates that the Engine no. 1 fuel dome, above the nozzle, ruptured but did not explode.  The burning fuel that exited before the engine was shut down caused the fairing rupture, as seen in the flight video recordings.  Subsequent investigations revealed in a Congressional hearing pinpointed the issue as a result of an undetected material flaw in the engine chamber jacket, likely introduced during engine production.  During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber.  This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure.  As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of Engine no. 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.

It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch.  The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets.  Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing.  However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult.  The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.  Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage.

630	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.  Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	85.31789005664177

An earlier test vehicle, the Grasshopper v1.0, began low-altitude, low-velocity return-to-Earth landing tests in late 2012 using a Merlin 1D main engine to reduce descent speed for vertical landing.   SpaceX' intent is to develop and refine the technology, over a period of several years, to achieve full and rapid reusability of the first stage by 2015, with complete launch vehicle reusability, including the second stage, to be worked on following that as ""part of a future design architecture."""	76.29799325810745
636	144_2-3	Tell me more about the rocket engines for Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Dragon, and Starship.	MARCO_50_1715454007-2	Merlin uses chilled RP-1 (which stands for “Rocket Propellant 1” and is basically kerosene) with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer. The various Dragon capsules use the “ Draco ” and “ SuperDraco ” engines.  The Draco’s use a “hypergolic” fuel which means that you mix two chemicals and they spontaneously combust - without needing any kind of ignition source.  Both rockets use monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.  When they fire, the exhaust is a very characteristic bright orange.  The StarShip and SuperHeavy use the “Raptor” engines.  Raptor uses liquid Methane (LCH4) as the fuel with liquid Oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer (this is sometimes called “Methalox”).  WHY SWITCH TO METHANE?  The switch from RP-1 to Methane comes about because SpaceX want to fly StarShip to Mars - and if they do that, there won’t be enough room on board to store enough fuel to get home again.  The nice thing about Methane is that it can be made from CO2 and Hydrogen - plus a good supply of electricity.  The atmosphere on Mars is almost all CO2, and hydrogen may be obtained by the electrolysis of water - which is fairly plentiful as ice below the surface of Mars.	89.52163138985634

638	144_2-3	Tell me more about the rocket engines for Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Dragon, and Starship.	MARCO_01_485275176-19	Rocket engines Main article: SpaceX rocket engines The Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in McGregor, Texas. Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines — Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor for use in launch vehicles, Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft, and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon .  Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants in a gas-generator power cycle.  Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage, and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.  The Merlin engine uses a pintle injector that provides deep-throttle capability used during Falcon 9 landings.  Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump .  Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine.  It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump, and is fed only by tank pressure.  The engine is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, and is radiatively cooled on the exhaust nozzle.  The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.	75.64994545932859
639	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	89.98173315799795
640	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067150539-6	Because of all these reasons, SpaceX chose rocket grade Kerosene for their Falcon rockets. Drawbacks of Kerosene (RP-1) Propellant: Kerosene produces soot, coking, and polymerization inside the Merlin engine.  As a result, after each rocket launch, SpaceX needs to clean its rocket engine thoroughly.  This process is costly and prevents SpaceX from reusing their rocket in rapid succession.  Though Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy’s Merlin engine uses liquid Kerosene, the Starship’s Raptor engine uses liquid Methane (CH4) as fuel.  Methane burns cleanly and far superior fuel for reusable rockets.  Nowadays, liquid Methane (CH4) is a commonly used rocket propellant.  However, it was not as prevalent before 2007.  SpaceX is building the Starship to send payload and humans to Mars.  Though there is no Methane on Mars, we can manufacture Methane via the Sabatier process.  In this process, we need to mix Carbon Dioxide (CO2) with Hydrogen (H) and then heat the mixture to produce Methane (CH4) and Water (H2O.)  The Martian atmosphere is an abundant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) and has water in the ground.  SpaceX can produce Hydrogen from Martian water.  On other planets in our solar system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all have Methane in their atmosphere.	79.66543782874942
641	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel.  However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant.  So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene?  SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines.  And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature.  It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).  It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets.  When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars.  However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable.  So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	76.42745404876769
642	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	90.3329146328615
643	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-5	It’s melting point is -259°C or -435°F, and its boiling point is -252°C or -423°F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.	84.46080970927142
644	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	KILT_27883135-25	Also, although not duct engines, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines have seen extensive use.  However, in almost every other way, hydrogen is problematic.  The downside of hydrogen is its density; in gaseous form the tanks are impractical for flight, but even in the form of liquid hydrogen it has a density one fourteenth that of water.  It is also deeply cryogenic and requires very significant insulation that precludes it being stored in wings.  The overall vehicle would end up being very large, and difficult for most airports to accommodate.  Finally, pure hydrogen is not found in nature, and must be manufactured either via steam reforming or expensive electrolysis.  A few experimental hydrogen-powered aircraft have flown with propellers, and jets have been proposed that may be feasible.   Section::::Advanced designs.:Precooled jet engines.   An idea originated by Robert P. Carmichael in 1955 is that hydrogen-fueled engines could theoretically have much higher performance than hydrocarbon-fueled engines if a heat exchanger were used to cool the incoming air.  The low temperature allows lighter materials to be used, a higher mass-flow through the engines, and permits combustors to inject more fuel without overheating the engine.	81.86082010203972
645	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	KILT_58673-3	In most rocket engines fueled by liquid hydrogen, it first cools the nozzle and other parts before being mixed with the oxidizer — usually liquid oxygen (LOX) — and burned to produce water with traces of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. Practical H–O rocket engines run fuel-rich so that the exhaust contains some unburned hydrogen.  This reduces combustion chamber and nozzle erosion.  It also reduces the molecular weight of the exhaust, which can actually increase specific impulse, despite the incomplete combustion.   Liquid hydrogen can be used as the fuel for an internal combustion engine or fuel cell.  Various submarines (Type 212 submarine, Type 214 submarine) and concept hydrogen vehicles have been built using this form of hydrogen (see DeepC, BMW H2R).  Due to its similarity, builders can sometimes modify and share equipment with systems designed for liquefied natural gas (LNG).  However, because of the lower volumetric energy, the hydrogen volumes needed for combustion are large.  Unless direct injection is used, a severe gas-displacement effect also hampers maximum breathing and increases pumping losses.   Liquid hydrogen is also used to cool neutrons to be used in neutron scattering.  Since neutrons and hydrogen nuclei have similar masses, kinetic energy exchange per interaction is maximum (elastic collision).	86.81945331394672

(with pictures)  Join the Community Subscribe to our newsletter and learn something new every day.  Eugene P. Last Modified Date: February 11, 2021 Eugene P. Date: February 11, 2021 Hydrogen is one of the primary propellants of a hydrogen rocket.  A hydrogen rocket is a vehicle that uses hydrogen and oxygen as its primary propellant.  By mixing the two gases and then igniting them, a reaction takes place that causes the release of a great amount of energy.  This energy can launch a vehicle upward and, if large enough, into space.  The widespread use of hydrogen rockets in the space industry over the years can be attributed to the fact that it uses one of the most efficient combustion reactions that can be created for propulsion.  Russia has used concentrated hydrogen peroxide to propel its rockets for decades.  The concept behind how and why a hydrogen rocket works has to do with the reaction between oxygen and hydrogen.  When hydrogen is exposed to an ignition source, it will not ignite unless there also is a specific amount of oxygen present.  A hydrogen rocket mixes hydrogen and oxygen in the correct ratio in a combustion chamber and then ignites the mixture, directing the force behind the rocket to make it move.	83.25797156896442
647	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_09_217844436-3	Rockets Since hydrogen is highly flammable, especially when mixed with pure oxygen, it is used as a fuel in rockets. Usually, they combine liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen to make an explosive mixture.  Unfortunately, in 1986, the U.S. Space Shuttle Challenger exploded when a flame accidentally ignited the liquid hydrogen in an external fuel tank.  This again showed that the gas can be dangerous and cause a disaster in some situations.  Clean fuel for cars But also, hydrogen is one of the cleanest fuels because when it burns, the result is simple water.  That is why there are efforts to create engines that can power automobiles on hydrogen.  This would greatly help to reduce the air pollution and global warming problems.  Although hydrogen is highly flammable, so also is gasoline.  Although care must be taken, the amount of hydrogen used in an automobile would present no more of a hazard than the amount of gasoline used.  One problem with using hydrogen to directly power an automobile is that it is very expensive to create pure hydrogen for this use.  Also, the most common method to create hydrogen for use in cars is with methane ( CH4) gas.  Although burning the hydrogen is pollution-free, methane is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect of global warming.	77.8523936746642

You can get away with smaller propellant tanks with ion engines, but you need a dense, high power source of electricity.  You can get a lot more thrust for a given energy input with electrothermal or chemical engines, but you need much bigger propellant tanks.  A photon rocket would be the most mass efficient, least energy efficient option...no propellant needed, but enormous amounts of power required to produce any useful thrust.  Photon sails use an external source of light so they don't have to carry around a massive power source and insanely bright light source, instead carrying a lightweight reflective sail, and are rather more practical than photon rockets.  They may use sunlight, but will also work with laser beams that could be produced electrically at a fixed installation.  Jul 7, 2010 #19 Lsos 803 9 I was wondering about the whole photon rocket concept...if matter/antimatter annihilation produces pure energy, wouldn't it be more practical to simply annihilate matter/antimatter (or even detonate a nuclear bomb) inside some sort of mirror-lined combustion chamber, instead of going through the whole nuclear reaction-electricity-preposterously bright flashlight process?	86.26330447656801

These massive engines certainly weighed plenty, however.  The 429 weighed in at 635 pounds, while the 460 was an incredible 720 pounds, living up to its ""big block"" heritage.  Obviously, the physical size of the engine displacement is reflected in the names of the engines.  Production Run Though both engines began their lives in 1968, the 429 was discontinued in 1973, while the 460 lasted all the way until 1996, seeing use exclusively in trucks.  However, in 1973, the 460 underwent a massive change, dropping from a robust 365 horsepower to a paltry 209 horsepower.  It was finally discontinued due to demands for a more efficient engine to respond to the newly environmentally aware consumers.  Stroke Length This is where most of the difference between the engines is made up.  The 429, with less displacement volume, had a shorter stroke length of 3.59, meaning it produced less power per camshaft rotation than the 460, which had a stroke length of 3.85, as mentioned above.  The longer stroke produces more power and also allows for more and better high-performance modifications."	95.0511191494188

CarGurus says that the Accord’s engine gets 192 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque, while the Civic gets 174 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque.	88.83031444612425

In a two-stroke engine, the burnt oil is released into the air with the exhaust.  Not only that, but two-stroke engines tend to live shorter than four-stroke engines since they require frequent shifting and operate at a higher RPM.  And yeah, two-stroke engines have less smooth power delivery which makes them difficult to control for less skilled riders.  On the other hand, two-stroke engines have an edge when it comes to maintenance costs, simplicity, and power.  If you didn’t know, a two-stroke 125cc engine is roughly the same as a four-stroke 250cc engine in terms of power.  And since dirt bikes can have up to 300cc two-stroke engines, they are much more powerful than pit bikes.  While dirt bikes commonly use two-stroke engines, some dirt bike types use four-stroke engines.  Four-stroke engines used in dirt bikes are more powerful than in pit bikes – 300-400cc displacement is pretty common, and some bikes reach as much as 750cc.  Body Pit bikes: pit bikes have a more compact and lightweight body that allows them to easily cover the confined pit courses.	83.42142430401873

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	89.55643275612965

665	145_1-3	What happens when all corals die?	MARCO_14_1269887941-9	When bleaching occurs, the reefs lose much of their characteristic color as the algae and the coral animals die if loss of the symbiotic zooxanthellae is prolonged. Rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide further threaten the corals in other ways; as CO 2 dissolves in ocean waters, it lowers the pH and increases ocean acidity.  As acidity increases, it interferes with the calcification that normally occurs as coral animals build their calcium carbonate homes.  When a coral reef begins to die, species diversity plummets as animals lose food and shelter.  Coral reefs are also economically important tourist destinations, so the decline of coral reefs poses a serious threat to coastal economies.  Human population growth has damaged corals in other ways, too.  As human coastal populations increase, the runoff of sediment and agricultural chemicals has increased, too, causing some of the once-clear tropical waters to become cloudy.  At the same time, overfishing of popular fish species has allowed the predator species that eat corals to go unchecked.  Although a rise in global temperatures of 1–2˚C (a conservative scientific projection) in the coming decades may not seem large, it is very significant to this biome.  When change occurs rapidly, species can become extinct before evolution leads to new adaptations.	73.78547089127824
666	145_1-5	What is the impact of dead corals on humans?	MARCO_16_3676861391-25	The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.  The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.  Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.  Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves.  Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life.  Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.  Climate change impacts on the environment Ecological collapse.  Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide.  Extreme weather.

But far less attention has been paid to heat waves over the ocean, which can have consequences of their own for both the marine environment and people.  “This increase in marine heat waves is having devastating impacts on coral reefs around the world,” said Mark Eakin, a coral reefs specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Eakin said damage to reefs from these heat waves was first seen in 1983 in coral bleaching events, which have increased in frequency and intensity.  In fact, Eakin and colleagues published a study in January that found coral reefs are bleaching four to five times as frequently as they did three decades ago.  In 2014, sea surface temperatures in the northeast Pacific Ocean were 5 to 6 degrees above normal, and marine biologists were stunned by the onslaught of outsider species up and down the West Coast of the United States.  Among those spotted were a live ocean sunfish and warm-water blue shark in the Gulf of Alaska, mahi mahi off the coast of Oregon, a Pacific sea turtle common in the Galapagos near San Francisco, and marlin in the waters off Southern California.	90.77892081509344

669	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	94.05719025311193
670	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_58_1622110619-2	In addition to these opportunities, a range of ocean-based carbon removal approaches could help capture and store billion of tons of carbon. Importantly, these approaches would not increase ocean acidification.  The ocean currently absorbs just under one-third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, which is contributing to a rise in ocean acidification and making it more difficult for organisms like oysters and corals to build shells.  A few options for increasing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon may also provide co-benefits, such as increasing biodiversity and reducing acidification.  However, many approaches remain contentious due to uncertainties around potential ecological impacts, governance and other risks.  If research efforts increase to improve understanding in these areas, a combination of approaches could help address the global climate crisis.  Ocean-based Ways to Remove CO 2 from the Atmosphere Proposed methods for increasing the ocean’s ability to remove and store carbon dioxide — including biological, chemical and electrochemical concepts — vary in technical maturity, permanence, public acceptance and risk.  Note: This graphic represents the general types of proposed approaches, but may not reflect every proposal.  1.  Biological Approaches Biological approaches, which leverage the power of photosynthesis to capture CO 2, offer a few approaches for carbon removal.	87.55527988815447

Corals do not have internal organs and nor do they need them.  Corals depend on algae, zooxanthellae, for their survival.  The two are mutually dependent.  The algae live inside the coral and use sunlight to produce energy which is used by the coral.  The algae in return get a home to live in and carbon dioxide released by the coral.  TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read) Corals do not produce their own energy but get energy from the algae that live within them.  Hence, they do not need a metabolism, blood, or heart.

One researcher thinks the immediate solution lies not with man, but within the coral itself.  Immunizing coral to pollution and rising climates could nurse dying populations back to health and reintroduce those that have died, marine science professor Caroline Palmer asserted in a paper published Monday in Nature's Communications Biology.  Select corals are able to tolerate stressors that threaten them based on their ecological system and the microorganisms they interact with, information researchers can use to treat coral to withstand future damage.  While significantly dampening humans' carbon footprint is still key to the reefs' long-term survival, understanding coral immunology can ""buy enough time to conserve sufficient coral,"" she wrote."	84.22145856177667

MARCO_36_1480232399-5	The final stage of the pump is when these clusters of dead phytoplankton reach the ocean floor where they, and the CO2 they contain, remain for thousands of years. Role of Calcium Carbonate Calcium Carbonate is the primary ingredient that Clams, oysters, coral, and other hard-bodied aquatic creatures depend on to create their hard shells.  This carbon compound is produced by carbon dioxide combining with calcium that has previously been dissolved in seawater.  When these organisms die, their body parts and shells sink deep into the ocean to the seafloor, thus hiding, or burying, carbon.  Over a long period of time, these dead organisms create carbonate-rich deposit layers on the floor of the ocean.  After millions of years have passed, more and more carbonates form, which then creates heat and pressure that causes them to turn into sedimentary rocks.  This includes chalk, marble, and limestone.  Examples of Natural Carbon Sinks Now that you know the three basics, here a just a few of the many natural carbon sinks found throughout the globe.	83.2746819785607

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.  How many different species live in reefs?  What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms.  Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology.  When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs.  5.  Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	93.09490317061136

Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white.  But there’s a lot more to it than that.  Coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae.  The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, each helping the other survive.  But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae.  As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached.  If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die.  Protect Coral Reefs You can help protect coral reefs, too.  Climate change poses a fundamental threat to coral reefs.  Simple steps such as carpooling to work or using mass transit can help reduce your carbon footprint and protect these vibrant ecosystems.

687	145_2-5	How much coral has been bleached?	WAPO_QVQ7DVUHHFCZLEONFBCD2PC2GA-2	The new survey of 100 major coral reefs, from 1980 through 2016, found only a handful that had not suffered severe bleachings during that period. More striking, it found that the rate of severe bleaching is increasing over time.   The average reef in the group bleached severely once every 25 or 30 years at the beginning of the 1980s, but by 2016 the recurrence time for severe bleaching was just 5.9 years.  The study said that as ocean waters have grown steadily warmer, global bleaching events are now triggered not only in warm water El Nino years, but potentially in any year, including cooler La Nina years.  The change has occurred during about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of overall global warming so far, highlighting the fact that corals — whose existence, based on an ancient symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, evolved millions of years ago — are a particularly sensitive system.  Eakin is one of 25 authors of the study in Science, whose contributors hail from institutions in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  The paper’s first author is Terry Hughes of the Australian Research Council Center for Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia.	88.35799594427226

""Three severe bleaching events in five years is not something we anticipated happening until the middle of the century.""  Climate change could kill all of Earth's coral reefs by 2100, scientists warn Warm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching, which is when corals turn white as a stress response to water that is too warm.  This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color.  Read More Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately.  But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.  Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching.  What he saw was unprecedented.  ""For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,"" he said.  Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching."	74.98819071683101

MARCO_45_976543044-4	Thanks to advanced technologies they document for the first time ever the third global bleaching occurred in 2015 (the first took place between 1997 and 1998 and the second in 2010). The third bleaching occurred only five years after the second.  This means that half the world’s corals died over just 30 years.  Why corals turn white Coral bleaching is one of the consequences of global warming, i.e. the rise in the global temperatures of both air and oceans caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, CO2) released into the atmosphere by human-related activities such as the burning of petroleum and coal.  According to the documentary, 93 per cent the heat released into the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean.  Without our oceans, we’ll be doomed.  Indeed, we would be already experiencing a temperature of 50 degrees, rather than talking about a 3-degree increase in the average temperature by the end of the century.  Corals in the American Samoa© XL Catlin Seaview Survey/The Ocean Agency/Richard Vevers And the first proofs of warming oceans and ocean acidification are coral bleaching and the death of corals.  Corals turn white because they get sick.  And their reaction to this “fever” is turning white, almost fluorescent, like they’re signalling their state of health.	74.10488594160415
690	146_1-1	What's the difference between bike packing and bike touring?	MARCO_18_438706474-27	Bikepacking Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.  Risks Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking, free ride and dirt jumping.	96.4795760809211

The Basics Given that this is our complete guide to bikepacking bags, we’ll begin with a few definitions for beginners.  Let’s first clarify the difference between bikepacking and bike touring.  Although neither are mutually exclusive — and there’s inevitably plenty of overlap — the two often diverge in the style of travel they encourage.  Traditional touring tends to be enjoyed on heavily laden bikes, and as a result, often gravitates towards paved routes and byways.  Minimal in style, modern bikepacking is based more on the exploration of off-pavement roads, backcountry trails, and singletrack.  Furthermore, the two are largely differentiated by the style of bag setup they’re associated with, and the bikes that are used.  Traditional touring uses racks and panniers; as a result, touring bikes bikes are designed for this purpose.  The beauty of bikepacking is in its simplicity: any bike can be a bikepacking bike.  Thanks to the advent of soft bags, bikepacking doesn’t depend on a particular frame having eyelets for racks and panniers.  Full-suspension, carbon, ‘cross, hardtail, fat, rigid — almost any bike will do.	90.99465619132388

You'll climb mountains and follow dirt trails deep through the woods, possibly for a few days.  the popularity trend of ""bicycle touring"" compared to ""bikepacking"" How to Select a Route?  Planning for a rural bike tour is similar to organizing a road trip.  You want to find routes with beautiful vistas that are easy to navigate on a bike.  You also should study the terrain so you have plenty of water sources and safe places to camp on your trip.  Depending on the length of your trip, you may have to plan some in-town trips to resupply, too.  In general, you can go anywhere you want on a bicycle tour.  When planning a tour, here are a few things to prioritize though: 1) Minimal Amount of Traffic.  You should avoid busy roads for safety reasons and choose paths that are less traveled.  At minimum, only ride on roads with a wide shoulder for a safe bike lane.  2) Campsite Options.  Yea... you will need a place to sleep.  Unlike hiking, where on-trail campsites are abundant, setting your tent on the side of the road can be a lot less reliable."	85.26465351495426

View at REI THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING BIKEPACKING BAGS STYLE There are seven main styles of bikepacking bags listed above: Trunk Bag These sit on top of a rear rack and are one of the larger bags used when bikepacking.  Pannier These are used in a pair for even weight distribution and are typically attached to a rear or front rack.  Panniers will often boast the largest carrying capacity of all the bags available for bikepacking.  Seat-Pack or Saddle-Bag These attach to your seat and seat post and come in a variety of sizes.  They are often used for lightweight touring and bikepacking.  Frame Bag These sit in the middle triangle of your bike frame and will either take up the entire area (full frame bag) or part of the area (half frame bag).  Frame bags are great for storing heavier items as they help keep the center of gravity low when riding.  Top Tube Bag These are small bags that sit on the top tube of your bike.  Top tube bags are commonly used for storing valuables and ride nutrition and they provide easy access while riding.	86.15746978856623
694	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_31_919842847-3	A bikepacking bike with a handlebar roll, frame bag, and seat pack The main bikepacking bags include: Handlebar harness or roll- This is basically a dry bag which secures to the handlebars with straps.  A handlebar harness uses a separate dry bag.  This way, you can use different size bags depending on the amount of gear you carry.  A handlebar roll has the dry bag built-in.  With both styles, you access your gear from the sides of the bag.  Handlebar bags usually hold 15-20 liters of gear.  Many models offer attachment points on the outside where you can attach a small bag or additional gear.  You can even attach your tent.  Frame bag-  This oddly shaped bag fits in the triangle of your bike frame.  Frame bags secure to the frame with velcro or straps around the top tube, down tube, and seat tube.  These usually hold 8-14 liters of equipment.  They are often custom made to maximize space because each bike frame has a slightly different triangle geometry.  These come in full frame and half frame sizes.  The half-size style allows you to utilize your water bottle attachments points in the triangle.  Most frame bags open with a zipper on the top of the bag.  The zippers tend to fail if the bags are overpacked.	76.49753460288048
695	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_51_244737344-6	There are bags, pouches and cages that attach to just about any little nook on your bike. If you’re struggling to pack a particular item or just need a little more storage space, search around for what’s out there and you just might find the exact thing to solve all your storage troubles.  Common Additional Storage Options for Bikepacking Stem bags: These small pouches attach behind your handlebar, usually to the handlebar and/or stem with a couple hook-and-loop strips.  Most bikepackers use one or more stem bags to keep small, frequently used items nearby.  Things like snacks, water, a map, a phone or sunglasses are good items to stash in there.  Some riders choose to keep their camera and extra lenses here.  Top tube bags: Usually a tad bigger than stem bags, top tube bags attach to the top of your top tube, behind your head tube.  There are also top tube bags that attach just in front of your seat post.  Top tube bags are often the easiest bags to get in and out of while you’re riding, so they’re great for holding small items that you use frequently, like energy bars, sunscreen, lip balm and a phone.  You might also keep a small multi-tool in here for quick repairs.	74.43675047159195

Can You Put a Pannier Rack On a Road Bike Road bikes are not much different from touring bikes, which is why the answer to this question is yes.  You can put a pannier rack on a road bike, or even a mountain bike for that matter, as long as the mounting holes are compatible.  However, you may still have follow-up questions, which is why we’re going to take a closer look at this matter.  A road bike does not have a fixed structure.  Some have eyelets, while others do not.  The length of the chainstay also differs.  Lastly, different materials can be used on the bike, resulting in different weights.  By considering these factors, you can find out how you can put a pannier rack on a road bike and which can be considered as one of the right pannier racks for road bike.  With or without eyelets – To begin with, if your road bike has eyelets, attaching a pannier rack is quite simple.  However, if there’s no eyelet, you should get racks that have clamps or brackets for the seat post.  With this component, installation is much easier but less secure.	79.5040628388524
697	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306906707-6	Can you put panniers on a road bike? You can put panniers on a road bike but you will need a special type of pannier rack to do this.  Since road bikes don’t have the mounting options on the frame (or ‘eyelets’) for adding a rack, you will need to buy a rear rack that attaches to your seat post to put panniers on your road bike.  The only downside to this is that the seat post racks generally have a lighter weight limit given the alternative mounting position.  That being said, on a bike commute you should still have no problems carrying all that you need on a road bike with panniers on a rack fitted in this way.  The same road bike as above with a rear seat-post rack.  This is an option if you want to commute on a road bike and carry panniers.  Road bikes don’t have the pannier rack option because they are designed for speed and are therefore made to be as streamlined as possible.  Adding panniers and a rack are therefore not what road bikes were originally intended for, but don’t let that stop you for your ride to work.

698	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306897671-3	You would need to use bolts that come with your panniers to attach them here. Your rack can then be attached using a few simple tools like hexkey and a wrench, so there is no real need to pay someone to do it, although it would be cheap if you needed to visit your local bike store to ask for help with this.  Do pannier racks fit all bikes?  No, unfortunately not all bikes can have standard pannier racks on them, with most road bikes not being able to hold a standard pannier rack.  That said, you can still buy a special seat-post-mounted rear rack that functions in a similar way to attach to your road bike.  Although this will work for most bike commuters on road bikes, you should be careful not to overload a seat-post-mounted pannier rack since road bikes are designed for speed and are not meant to be weighted down.  It is true that their frames can handle a fair amount of weight, but having this strain on your seat post, combined with it affecting the geometry of your road bike, could make it a little difficult to control your road bike if commuting with weighty pannier bags on the back.	73.41825691796839

708	147_1-1	What do you think is the best Marvel movie?	MARCO_50_2255250854-13	Some of Marvel’s best which aren’t on this list: -Captain America: Winter Soldier/Nothing connected to Endgame, but it’s one of the best MCU movies -Black Panther/ Very different movie in terms of tone, excellent villain -Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2/ I personally love this film, a lot of people seem to keep it lower on the list, but it’s definitely worth checking out -Ironman/ Amazing movie, introduces one of the best characters in the MCU perfectly.  -Spider-Man: Homecoming/ A great solo film that has a fantastic villain and great performance from Tom Holland.  So yeah, that’s pretty much it, the other movies (Thor, Ant-Man) are good, but Ironman 2 and 3 can be skipped as well as Incredible Hulk.  I’d say watch Thor: The Dark World just for the one plot point, but you can even skip that honestly.  Hope you enjoy!  Related Answer James Henry , Big fan of the character.

From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man By GamesRadar Staff 5 months ago Look back on a decade of the best Marvel movies – now with added Spider-Man: Far From Home!  (Image credit: Disney/Marvel)  With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect.  There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable.  But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible – we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time.  The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other – so there's loads of choice.  The good news is you can stream most of the MCU on Disney Plus now, and there's never been a better time to get caught up as new series launch on Disney Plus throughout the year, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.	76.01892638579011

Average reader score: 8.108765037. 9.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2 Arguably the best Marvel movie ever (at least as a standalone piece of cinema), The Winter Soldier wasn't even the best-ranked Captain America movie according to Inverse readers.  Then again, as you'll soon see, this list favors big ensemble casts over tightly paced thrillers.  Average reader score: 8.187722192. 8.  Iron Man (2008)  Over a decade after its release, the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe still holds up.  From Robert Downey Jr.'s unexpected winning performance (director Jon Favreau had to fight to cast his star) to Samuel L. Jackson's quotable first appearance in the post-credits scene, there's a lot to love in Iron Man.  Average reader score: 8.313602971. 7.  Captain America: Civil War (2016) Maybe not the best Captain America story, but arguably the most important movie that bears his name, Civil War is basically an Avengers film in disguise.	88.53097361093387
712	147_1-3	Remind me of the elevator scene from Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)	MARCO_41_107614308-20	Infinity War manages to be emotionally powerful and incredibly funny (often in the same scene), its scale and scope are mind-bogglingly vast, and the crossover character interactions are unexpected and fun. Perhaps, most importantly, Marvel solves its villain problem in spectacular style, with Josh Brolin’s Thanos being both the driving force of the movie and a plausible bad guy – his grand plan is clearly deranged, but there's a weird, twisted logic to it.  And without Infinity War there could be no Endgame.  1.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  Here it is.  The best Marvel movie.  The Winter Soldier set a new precedent for the MCU.  The Captain America sequel is a totally different take on the universe – a ’70s Cold War thriller that doesn't put a foot wrong.  Hell, The Winter Soldier should be named one of the best Marvel movies of all time for the elevator scene alone; a moment so memorable it was homaged in Avengers: Endgame.  The movie also has far-reaching implications for the rest of the Marvel universe – such as that SHIELD reveal – and establishes the resurrected Bucky Barnes as a major piece in the puzzle for years to come.	88.23592619481497

It can summon the clouds themselves and charge insane lightning bolts toward its enemies, with beings like Iron Man being completely incapacitated with a single attack.  Unfortunately, Hela destroyed it in short order, and we’ve seen powerful beings be able to parry its offense.  But if you apply the worthy clause, no one should be able to lift it at all in a fight.  4 Thanos’ Double-edged Sword This sword went unnamed in Avengers: Endgame, but it’s a shame we didn’t get to find out more about its properties, because the sword was incredibly powerful.  Thanos wielded it with a winning streak of almost a 100-percent, until Scarlet Witch was able to beat him.

I loved Captain America being worthy and fighting off Thanos I loved Peter Parker’s reunite with Tony Stark I loved Captain America saying Avengers Assemble, and the portal scene I loved Tony Stark outsmarting Thanos, and becoming the first mortal to use the Infinity Stones.  I think this movie is really good, I really do.  But this movie isn’t flawless, it’s not perfect.  I don’t think RDJ deserves an Oscar nomination, I don’t think this movie is as good as Shawshank redemption, or Inception.  There are too many flaws, and I prefer the original Avenger movie than this.  The 2012 Avengers had less characters to juggle with, better pacing, and better humor.  I wanted to like this movie, and make it a 9 out of 10 like most people.  But to me, there are so many factors that bring this movie down.  The more I watch it, the more flaws I found.  In conclusion, what disappointed me in Endgame was: Humor, life-less filter, off-screen development, and first two hours.

This movie takes place at the same time as Infinity War.  And while I really feel that watching Infinity War and Endgame back-to-back is most powerful, the end-credits scene could be a major spoiler.  It’s also important to Endgame to know where Ant-Man is, so I have to place it in this order for maximum effect.  22.

This film became the fastest to hit $1 billion and was later re-released again in theaters with extra scenes for the first time in an MCU film.  The re-release made Avengers: Endgame become the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing the film Avatar .  By contrast, the June X-Men film Dark Phoenix performed poorly upon release due in part to poor critical reception.  In addition, it was observed that there was noticeable fan indifference for a concluding film series of a property that would be put in the complete control of Marvel Studios producer, Kevin Feige, along with the Fantastic Four, for integration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise in due time considering Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox.  In July 2019, Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was concluded with the Sony film, Spider-Man: Far From Home which was released to critical and commercial success.	81.89731309050694

720	147_1-9	That’s a fair point, but I would argue that Iron man and Thor had great arcs like Captain America in their own movies.	MARCO_50_2240949679-3	Iron Man, Thor, Captain America 1, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther are all great origin stories for each of the main hero where each character learns to grow and all feel different from one another with Captain America 1 taking up back to the 40s filled with great action, Doctor Strange introducing us to the multiverse and mystic arts with inspiring visuals, Black Panther taking us to Africa and telling a story about kingship, Ant-Man being a suspenseful heist movie about family, Thor being a coming of age story and taking us to a whole new world and Iron Man starting the MCU with some high stakes. All 4 Avengers movies have great characters, stories, character interactions, visuals and some of the best action in the MCU.  Iron Man 2 and 3 develop Tony’s character really well and have decent action within, WS + Civil War create a more ambitious political character driven plot with tons of heart and great team ups and action and Guardians 1 and 2 just take everything I want in a great movie and combine it all beautifully (aside from a great villain in Guardians 1 and maybe too much humor).

Thor- A well told story, but I find the movie can get boring at times if not watched with friends.  Absolutely fantastic special effects and performances.  Captain America: The First Avenger-  First on the MCU timeline, but it’s nothing too special.  other than the fact it’s set during WWII, this is just another run-of-the-mill superhero story.  The Avengers-  You have to see it to believe it.  It’s more than just another summer blockbuster, this has memorable characters, great dialogue, good storytelling, and just overall fun!  Iron Man 3-  A superhero film that tries to be artsy, this film is pretty good.

Avengers: Endgame will perhaps forever stand as the most monumental installment in the franchise, but Spider-Man: Far From Home actually closed out Phase 3.  The next phase of the MCU will break even more boundaries than it did before, with the promise of the multiverse and maybe even more time travel in the franchise's future.  Disney has been updating its movie release date calendar following the 20th Century Fox acquisition and, with the COVID-19 pandemic throwing everything into uncertainty, films like Black Widow and Eternals were pushed back, first by several months and then more than a year, with both films shifting to 2021.

[  Note: Marvel is quick to say that it already had diverse hires planned when the controversy occurred.]  Alonso has heard the criticism and said that even before such complaints went viral, Marvel was working to diversify both the content within its pages and its roster of creative talent.  “You’re always going to get complaints, but the key thing is, we’re looking for great writers,” Alonso said.  “I’m extremely excited about our lineup.”  “We’re always mindful of finding diverse talent,” Alonso noted.  “If you take a look at our recent announcements [  Black Panther, Totally Awesome Hulk], which were underway more than a year ago, we were conscious of this and working towards this long before anybody had any complaints.”  As for the years-in-the-making event that preceded Civil War II — and which recently concluded after delays — Alonso said that he was proud of the highly anticipated finish of Jonathan Hickman’s Secret Wars.  “I think Jonathan not only stuck the landing for [  Secret Wars], but also for our larger goals to transform the Marvel universe,” Alonso said.	91.33754925960966

MARCO_50_2240949679-117	And while that works with a character like Batman, other characters’ movies like Wonder Woman or Justice League do not benefit from being filmed in the same dark, David Fincher-esque style of filmmaking. This is the reason DC has recently announced Justice League would be re-edited to avoid this approach.  Suicide Squad made sense being grim and gritty because at it’s core, that was a movie about criminals seeking redemption.  DC has not been able to make their movies different enough from one another.  They take the same approach to Wonder Woman that they took to Batman which is a creative choice that baffles me.  It’s like their producers chose the wrong aspects of the Chris Nolan Batman movies to recreate and it hasn’t served them well.  People liked his Batman trilogy because they were really solid, great films; not because of the dark color palette or moody atmosphere.  Marvel on the other hand has actual diversity in their films.  They have made straight up action/superheroic blockbusters, they’ve done sci-fi, they’ve done gory horror, light-hearted family films, romance, comedies, heist movies, childrens/young adult movies and I only see them doing more in terms of genre films.  Marvel has this thing called variety, something the DCEU sorely needs.	89.5591285619812

WAPO_C6IMP7MJ3ZEQZJPNSY27GJGIQY-1	THE CHANGE seems to arrive not as coincidence: The past four films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe have featured a female lead of color.  In the 15 months since “Doctor Strange” faced accusations of “whitewashing” Tilda Swinton’s ancient mystic character in the film, Marvel has embraced its fuller turn toward diversity.  This Friday’s “Black Panther” spotlights the Oscar-winning Lupita Nyong’o as Nakia, a Wakandan spy who fights alongside the title character and his fierce all-female special forces unit, the Dora Milaje.  For the Kenyan-raised Nyong’o, it’s a chance to escape the veil of CGI effects in Disney’s “Jungle Book” and Star Wars franchise and play a high-profile part in a film that celebrates Africa.  Her arrival was preceded last year by Zoe Saldana as the green-tinted Gamora in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.  2″; Zendaya as Peter Parker’s “pal” Michelle/MJ in Sony’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming”; and Tessa Thompson’s boozing and battling Valkyrie in “Thor: Ragnarok.”	86.32683757884661
729	147_2-1	What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?	WAPO_49520e943a578fcd2bf2b5f2b0de785f-4	In an op-ed for the Guardian, comics critic J.A. Micheline rejected the idea that diversity could be blamed for poor sales and urged the comic-book industry to expand its audience. “I can promise you that it’s not women going into comic-book shops, sick of female characters,” Micheline wrote.  “I can similarly promise you that people of color are not entering comic-book shops and turning their noses up at faces that look like theirs.  By even making remarks like these, Marvel is seemingly conceding that its target audience, its ‘core’ audience — and their ‘core’ characters — are white and male.”  Little wonder that Marvel Studios, a Disney subsidiary that owns such lucrative franchises as “The Avengers,” “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” has been slower to reflect diverse characters on the big screen.  A popular graphic put together in 2015 by Twitter users @fauxparse and @comikazejeff pointed out that, “more often, Marvel heroes are played by white dudes named Chris than all women put together.”  The graphic above is two years old now, but even updating for newer Marvel releases like “Captain America: Civil War,” “Doctor Strange” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.	91.29169007478048

Many ComicsGate people point to Marvel catering to diverse populations of fans by putting female and ethnically diverse heroes front and center to garner sales.  Of course companies like Marvel will advertise characters to specific demographics to best deliver stories to the right audiences.  Successful stories tend to be marketed to the proper demographic.  You wouldn’t get angry at, say, Harry Potter for advertising to children and families, would you?  No, because children and families are the primary audience of the Harry Potter series.  Likewise, why should anyone be angry at Get Out for advertising to African-Americans?  Or for Marvel advertising Ms. Marvel, a title featuring an Islamic-American lead, to Islamic-Americans?  So the idea that marketing your story to someone other than white cishet men is “bad”…does that really hold any weight?  So no.  Logically, we are left with option one.  Forced Diversity is a buzzword.  It’s meaningless.  No one with any critical perspective is going to use this word in a meaningful context because the term has no meaning.	86.73936774616595

Micheline rejected the idea that diversity could be blamed for poor sales and urged the comic-book industry to expand its audience. “I can promise you that it’s not women going into comic-book shops, sick of female characters,” Micheline wrote.  “I can similarly promise you that people of color are not entering comic-book shops and turning their noses up at faces that look like theirs.  By even making remarks like these, Marvel is seemingly conceding that its target audience, its ‘core’ audience — and their ‘core’ characters — are white and male.”  Little wonder that Marvel Studios, a Disney subsidiary that owns such lucrative franchises as “The Avengers,” “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” has been slower to reflect diverse characters on the big screen.  A popular graphic put together in 2015 by Twitter users @fauxparse and @comikazejeff pointed out that, “more often, Marvel heroes are played by white dudes named Chris than all women put together.”  The graphic above is two years old now, but even updating for newer Marvel releases like “Captain America: Civil War,” “Doctor Strange” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.	88.08721569538466

From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man By GamesRadar Staff 5 months ago Look back on a decade of the best Marvel movies – now with added Spider-Man: Far From Home!  (Image credit: Disney/Marvel)  With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect.  There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable.  But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible – we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time.  The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other – so there's loads of choice.  The good news is you can stream most of the MCU on Disney Plus now, and there's never been a better time to get caught up as new series launch on Disney Plus throughout the year, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.	76.01892638579011

Perhaps, most importantly, Marvel solves its villain problem in spectacular style, with Josh Brolin’s Thanos being both the driving force of the movie and a plausible bad guy – his grand plan is clearly deranged, but there's a weird, twisted logic to it.  And without Infinity War there could be no Endgame.  1.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  Here it is.  The best Marvel movie.  The Winter Soldier set a new precedent for the MCU.  The Captain America sequel is a totally different take on the universe – a ’70s Cold War thriller that doesn't put a foot wrong.  Hell, The Winter Soldier should be named one of the best Marvel movies of all time for the elevator scene alone; a moment so memorable it was homaged in Avengers: Endgame.  The movie also has far-reaching implications for the rest of the Marvel universe – such as that SHIELD reveal – and establishes the resurrected Bucky Barnes as a major piece in the puzzle for years to come.	88.23592619481497

It can summon the clouds themselves and charge insane lightning bolts toward its enemies, with beings like Iron Man being completely incapacitated with a single attack.  Unfortunately, Hela destroyed it in short order, and we’ve seen powerful beings be able to parry its offense.  But if you apply the worthy clause, no one should be able to lift it at all in a fight.  4 Thanos’ Double-edged Sword This sword went unnamed in Avengers: Endgame, but it’s a shame we didn’t get to find out more about its properties, because the sword was incredibly powerful.

I don’t think RDJ deserves an Oscar nomination, I don’t think this movie is as good as Shawshank redemption, or Inception.  There are too many flaws, and I prefer the original Avenger movie than this.  The 2012 Avengers had less characters to juggle with, better pacing, and better humor.  I wanted to like this movie, and make it a 9 out of 10 like most people.  But to me, there are so many factors that bring this movie down.  The more I watch it, the more flaws I found.

This film became the fastest to hit $1 billion and was later re-released again in theaters with extra scenes for the first time in an MCU film.  The re-release made Avengers: Endgame become the highest-grossing film of all time, surpassing the film Avatar .  By contrast, the June X-Men film Dark Phoenix performed poorly upon release due in part to poor critical reception.  In addition, it was observed that there was noticeable fan indifference for a concluding film series of a property that would be put in the complete control of Marvel Studios producer, Kevin Feige, along with the Fantastic Four, for integration into the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise in due time considering Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox.

MARCO_50_2240949679-3	Iron Man, Thor, Captain America 1, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther are all great origin stories for each of the main hero where each character learns to grow and all feel different from one another with Captain America 1 taking up back to the 40s filled with great action, Doctor Strange introducing us to the multiverse and mystic arts with inspiring visuals, Black Panther taking us to Africa and telling a story about kingship, Ant-Man being a suspenseful heist movie about family, Thor being a coming of age story and taking us to a whole new world and Iron Man starting the MCU with some high stakes. All 4 Avengers movies have great characters, stories, character interactions, visuals and some of the best action in the MCU.  Iron Man 2 and 3 develop Tony’s character really well and have decent action within, WS + Civil War create a more ambitious political character driven plot with tons of heart and great team ups and action and Guardians 1 and 2 just take everything I want in a great movie and combine it all beautifully (aside from a great villain in Guardians 1 and maybe too much humor).

(Note: There will be discussion of movie plot points here — including key events in Avengers: Endgame and Spider-Man: Far From Home — so consider this a spoiler warning if you’re not caught up with the MCU.)  Movies on the books Marvel Studios currently has a long list of films in various stages of development or casting.	85.12104269763222

MARCO_27_1501997631-1	Every Upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie | Screen Rant Every Upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Here is every upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe movie slated for release - including MCU's Phase 4 and possibly even Phase 5 - from 2021 and beyond.  By Kara Hedash Published May 04, 2021 Share Share Tweet Email 0 Comment Last Updated: May 4, 2021 The Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 3 is over, and now all eyes have turned to Phase 4 and even the MCU's Phase 5.  Avengers: Endgame will perhaps forever stand as the most monumental installment in the franchise, but Spider-Man: Far From Home actually closed out Phase 3.  The next phase of the MCU will break even more boundaries than it did before, with the promise of the multiverse and maybe even more time travel in the franchise's future.  Disney has been updating its movie release date calendar following the 20th Century Fox acquisition and, with the COVID-19 pandemic throwing everything into uncertainty, films like Black Widow and Eternals were pushed back, first by several months and then more than a year, with both films shifting to 2021.  Things shifted enough that WandaVision emerged as the first MCU project set in Phase 4, with The Falcon and the Winter Soldier coming second.	84.87837649392895

WAPO_1462c3a724913bbafa0b5e8ef32f76d4-4	Marvel has been criticized in media and social media for the lack of creative diversity behind its recent popular hip hop covers. [  Note: Marvel is quick to say that it already had diverse hires planned when the controversy occurred.]  Alonso has heard the criticism and said that even before such complaints went viral, Marvel was working to diversify both the content within its pages and its roster of creative talent.  “You’re always going to get complaints, but the key thing is, we’re looking for great writers,” Alonso said.  “I’m extremely excited about our lineup.”  “We’re always mindful of finding diverse talent,” Alonso noted.  “If you take a look at our recent announcements [  Black Panther, Totally Awesome Hulk], which were underway more than a year ago, we were conscious of this and working towards this long before anybody had any complaints.”  As for the years-in-the-making event that preceded Civil War II — and which recently concluded after delays — Alonso said that he was proud of the highly anticipated finish of Jonathan Hickman’s Secret Wars.  “I think Jonathan not only stuck the landing for [  Secret Wars], but also for our larger goals to transform the Marvel universe,” Alonso said.	91.33754925960966
757	147_1-13	That’s a great point. What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity?	MARCO_50_2240949679-117	And while that works with a character like Batman, other characters’ movies like Wonder Woman or Justice League do not benefit from being filmed in the same dark, David Fincher-esque style of filmmaking. This is the reason DC has recently announced Justice League would be re-edited to avoid this approach.  Suicide Squad made sense being grim and gritty because at it’s core, that was a movie about criminals seeking redemption.  DC has not been able to make their movies different enough from one another.  They take the same approach to Wonder Woman that they took to Batman which is a creative choice that baffles me.  It’s like their producers chose the wrong aspects of the Chris Nolan Batman movies to recreate and it hasn’t served them well.  People liked his Batman trilogy because they were really solid, great films; not because of the dark color palette or moody atmosphere.  Marvel on the other hand has actual diversity in their films.  They have made straight up action/superheroic blockbusters, they’ve done sci-fi, they’ve done gory horror, light-hearted family films, romance, comedies, heist movies, childrens/young adult movies and I only see them doing more in terms of genre films.  Marvel has this thing called variety, something the DCEU sorely needs.	89.5591285619812
758	147_1-13	That’s a great point. What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity?	WAPO_C6IMP7MJ3ZEQZJPNSY27GJGIQY-1	THE CHANGE seems to arrive not as coincidence: The past four films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe have featured a female lead of color.  In the 15 months since “Doctor Strange” faced accusations of “whitewashing” Tilda Swinton’s ancient mystic character in the film, Marvel has embraced its fuller turn toward diversity.  This Friday’s “Black Panther” spotlights the Oscar-winning Lupita Nyong’o as Nakia, a Wakandan spy who fights alongside the title character and his fierce all-female special forces unit, the Dora Milaje.  For the Kenyan-raised Nyong’o, it’s a chance to escape the veil of CGI effects in Disney’s “Jungle Book” and Star Wars franchise and play a high-profile part in a film that celebrates Africa.  Her arrival was preceded last year by Zoe Saldana as the green-tinted Gamora in “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.  2″; Zendaya as Peter Parker’s “pal” Michelle/MJ in Sony’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming”; and Tessa Thompson’s boozing and battling Valkyrie in “Thor: Ragnarok.”	86.32683757884661
759	147_1-15	Could you expand on Justin Gilbert Alba’s comments that the push from fans for diversity in creators and characters only represents a loud minority?	MARCO_35_1346382367-4	"Shuri’s adventures could help expand the world of Wakanda on-screen, while her attachment to T'Challa would add a compelling family dynamic. Hollywood loves family drama in movies anyway, so why not add some brother-sister angst to the Marvel milieu?  8 Gamora People would likely be surprised if Gamora, the assassin from 2014’s "" Guardians of the Galaxy ,"" got her own film, but she wouldn’t be a completely unexpected choice.  She’s already being played by Zoe Saldana of "" Avatar "" and "" Star Trek "" fame.  It’s not hard to imagine that Marvel might leverage her name recognition for a Gamora movie.  Then again, Guardians members Groot and Rocket Racoon are more popular because of their all-ages appeal, so they’d probably get kid-friendly animated films or tie-ins before Gamora would get anything of her own.  Regardless, if Saldana starred in her own Gamora movie, it would open up an interesting corner of Marvel’s cosmic universe.  A seasoned killer who is willing to take things farther than most other heroes, Gamora is a darker character than Captain Marvel, so her movie’s plot would possibly be edgier.  At the same time, they are both galactic heavyweights, and Gamora would bring a different presence to her cinematic adventures."	85.73443703708472

Gamora Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, is the adopted daughter of Thanos.  She has extraordinary fighting power and seeks redemption as one of the Guardians of the Galaxy. 8.  Captain Marvel Last, but certainly not least is Captain Marvel, also known as Carol Danvers.  Having got her powers from encounters with aliens, she has fought a good fight for years.  She is not officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but we have gotten ample hints that she will be coming to the big screen soon!  Best Female Marvel Villains Hela the Goddess of Asguard We found Hela, played by Cate Blanchett last year as she made her appearance as the daughter of Odin in Thor: Ragnarok.  If there were ever to be an all female Marvel superhero movie, she would be a top choice of mine for the female Marvel villain to out-fight all other villains!

MARCO_27_1457199454-15	Fans can already see the diverse casts taking shape with Don Cheadle's War Machine, Anthony Mackie's Falcon, and Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther playing large roles in this year's Civil War. 2018's Black Panther will be the first MCU film to feature a non-white lead, and Marvel has already cast Zendaya and Tessa Thompson to play Mary Jane in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Valkyrie in Thor: Ragnarok, respectively.  This trend is long overdue and one that is certain to continue in Phase 4 and beyond.  4 Female superheroes will be more prominent than ever Another area in which the MCU has been severely lacking so far is overall representation of female superheroes.  Though Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow has been a staple in the MCU since her character's introduction in Iron Man 2 (and has appeared in four films since), the only other female heroes through the first ten films were Jaime Alexander's Sif and Zoe Saldana's Gamora.  It took Marvel eleven films to finally introduce a second female avenger when it added Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch to the mix in Avengers: Age of Ultron.  The team will start to balance out in the near-future, however, with the additions of Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.	85.14155922504142

MARCO_53_638341371-3	As we know, education is about knowledge.whether you are a student or businessman or employees or whatever,you need the knowledge to do those roles well. So education provides knowledge for that, and that is the main importance of education.  Confidence Education can increase our confidence and the way we think.  Whoever you are, if you are an educated person, you can face any issue with a positive mind.  Without education, we fail in every place.  We will lose when we don’t have knowledge.  But a person with an excellent education can face anything with confidence.  Also, he will have smartest ways to look at the problems.  Becoming successful is not about minimizing your weaknesses and go on.  It is also about thinking smart and has confidence in yourself.  Enhancing the skills Education helps us to build skills like time management skills, interpersonal skills, organization skills etc.  Those obviously help us when becoming successful.  Schools create our knowledge skills, universities build our soft skills, and our experiences build our working skills.  Whatever the source is, it helps to develop our skills.  Whether you are an employee or a business owner, these skills we gained from education become an aid to your profession.  That’s a main importance of education.	91.92725806905946

Organizations in college help you meet and interact with other people who might be an expert in your field.  By connecting to your network, you learn and advance more quickly than just sitting with books by yourself.  Broader Knowledge and Experience Post-secondary education is a means of gaining knowledge and skills that will lead you to your goals.  It gives you the ability to perceive things as widely as possible, solve more complex problems, write and speak more effectively, and even improve your decision-making skills.  Independence in Overcoming Hardships Personal growth consists of experiences where you learn to overcome adversity that life throws at you.  A college degree does not only teach you how to overcome problems you encounter with your program but also prepares you with real-life challenges.  College requires traits that will help you develop through stress.  Passing tests, completing homework, and research papers will train you with necessary life skills like time management, teamwork, and even resourcefulness.  College teaches you that hard work and discipline are two essential things that make life a little easier.  Flexible Time and Schedule The flexibility that comes with convenience makes online college appealing to students at this age.	90.20522749837257

The Necessity for Continued Education in Today’s World According to a 2016 study, “35 percent of workers say they don’t feel they have the education and training they need to get ahead in work.”  To take ownership of their careers, many of these workers are re-enrolling in school and trying to obtain the knowledge and skill sets they need to move up in their jobs.  This practice is becoming commonplace in society today, with a total of 45 percent of employed adults opting to invest in continued training to improve the skills most relevant to their duties at work.  Americans are also starting to understand that, in order to stay on top of changing trends, they need to continue learning and developing new skills throughout their careers.  In fact, 54 percent of adults acknowledge that they will need to pursue future training in their fields to “keep up with the changes in the workplace.”  For adults without a bachelor’s degree, the correlation between career advancement and continued education is even more substantial.	86.64723211334785

You will find that you will become ""the security guru"" in your office pretty quick by doing that and from there, the transition becomes a lot easier.""  2. Sometimes it’s who you know--so network This is something that’s true across industries.  Tierney says, ""Professional networking.  Get to know as many people in the industry as you can.  Get involved in open source or community projects.  Another thing often overlooked in networking is offering to help others more than you ask for help.""  In-person networking is ideal: get involved in meetups, attend conferences, ask for tips over coffee with current security professionals of local tech companies.  If these things aren’t possible, online networking is a good idea too.  3.  Not in tech yet?

MARCO_56_1350200043-5	Research local events in your area, and start networking Did you know that the majority of jobs—regardless of field—are not formally advertised? To access hidden jobs, you need to become proficient in networking, both online and off.  Google tech-based events in your area, and look for regular local meetups.  You’ll form professional relationships with people who can give you advice on how to break into the industry, find the right training for your preferred career path, or even give you a job.  Find seasoned industry professionals who are happy to provide support and encouragement to novice.  If you’re lucky, you may even find yourself a mentor.  8.  Be willing to take on an entry-level role that offers potential for advancement and training If you are working at a mid-tier or high-level role in your current job, you might have to apply for junior positions when establishing yourself in a tech field.  This will mean taking a cut in salary.  Fortunately, if you are willing to expand your skill set and choose a company that takes a proactive approach to staff development, you will be working in a senior role within a few years.  A final note Remember, demand for tech talent currently outstrips supply.	87.93309911421966
780	148_1-3	How would education have a positive impact on my tech career?	MARCO_53_638341371-3	As we know, education is about knowledge.whether you are a student or businessman or employees or whatever,you need the knowledge to do those roles well. So education provides knowledge for that, and that is the main importance of education.  Confidence Education can increase our confidence and the way we think.  Whoever you are, if you are an educated person, you can face any issue with a positive mind.  Without education, we fail in every place.  We will lose when we don’t have knowledge.  But a person with an excellent education can face anything with confidence.  Also, he will have smartest ways to look at the problems.  Becoming successful is not about minimizing your weaknesses and go on.  It is also about thinking smart and has confidence in yourself.  Enhancing the skills Education helps us to build skills like time management skills, interpersonal skills, organization skills etc.  Those obviously help us when becoming successful.  Schools create our knowledge skills, universities build our soft skills, and our experiences build our working skills.  Whatever the source is, it helps to develop our skills.  Whether you are an employee or a business owner, these skills we gained from education become an aid to your profession.  That’s a main importance of education.	91.92725806905946

MARCO_48_1822136473-43	This is possible through other people’s recommendations, learning from other professionals, alumni, and educators in college. Organizations in college help you meet and interact with other people who might be an expert in your field.  By connecting to your network, you learn and advance more quickly than just sitting with books by yourself.  Broader Knowledge and Experience Post-secondary education is a means of gaining knowledge and skills that will lead you to your goals.  It gives you the ability to perceive things as widely as possible, solve more complex problems, write and speak more effectively, and even improve your decision-making skills.  Independence in Overcoming Hardships Personal growth consists of experiences where you learn to overcome adversity that life throws at you.  A college degree does not only teach you how to overcome problems you encounter with your program but also prepares you with real-life challenges.  College requires traits that will help you develop through stress.  Passing tests, completing homework, and research papers will train you with necessary life skills like time management, teamwork, and even resourcefulness.  College teaches you that hard work and discipline are two essential things that make life a little easier.  Flexible Time and Schedule The flexibility that comes with convenience makes online college appealing to students at this age.	90.20522749837257

The Necessity for Continued Education in Today’s World According to a 2016 study, “35 percent of workers say they don’t feel they have the education and training they need to get ahead in work.”  To take ownership of their careers, many of these workers are re-enrolling in school and trying to obtain the knowledge and skill sets they need to move up in their jobs.  This practice is becoming commonplace in society today, with a total of 45 percent of employed adults opting to invest in continued training to improve the skills most relevant to their duties at work.  Americans are also starting to understand that, in order to stay on top of changing trends, they need to continue learning and developing new skills throughout their careers.  In fact, 54 percent of adults acknowledge that they will need to pursue future training in their fields to “keep up with the changes in the workplace.”  For adults without a bachelor’s degree, the correlation between career advancement and continued education is even more substantial.	86.64723211334785

MARCO_19_1519183645-2	Having a degree, doing an apprenticeship or just simply carrying out work experience could all give you a way into the tech and engineering industries. If you’re just starting out in your career, why not consider studying a technology or engineering related subject at University, such as Computer Science?  Or, alternatively, study at college whilst working as an apprentice at a local company?  Remember, breaking into the tech and engineering industries isn’t only possible for young people at the beginning of their careers.  Those who are looking to change career could consider studying at evening or weekend classes, or, if it is financially feasible, work part-time whilst studying, 2) Get to know the sector Both the tech and engineering industries are incredibly vast, so in order to narrow down your options it’s worthwhile gaining experience in a few roles.  This will give you direction when job hunting, and give you the opportunity to find local companies that will allow you to shadow them; perhaps you have a family friend that works in tech?  Ask if you can come in for a day or two and see which role or department interests you most.  For a lot of people wanting to break into these industries, salary is the most important factor.	86.11368115519872

MARCO_12_1255601134-3	For example, a candidate interested in an entry level tech support job may highlight customer service skills on their resume. This skill is transferable to the job because helping customers or clients troubleshoot software takes patience, professionalism and high-quality communication.  Include Language From Job Description Where Relevant Including specific language from the job description in a resume can help candidates showcase their unique fit for the role.  It can also help recruiters assess the value your experiences can bring to the role you’re applying for.  For example, a job description for a help desk analyst may use the phrase “record, track and document.”  Candidates should think about a time they had to record, track and document something, and include a description of what they did, along with the phrase, in their resume.  Always Write A Cover Letter When applying for an entry level tech job with no experience, always write a cover letter.  A cover letter offers an opportunity to share your story and provide details about yourself that may not be obvious in your resume.  Take the space to share why you’re interested in the role, the company and the tech industry overall.  Following these tips will help improve a candidate’s chances of getting an entry level job with no experience.	80.92791655508336

Recruiters actively search for candidates on Facebook, Twitter and sites like Stack Overflow.  However, LinkedIn is still the best place to get noticed.  Treat your LinkedIn profile like your resume — keep it updated and make it as attractive as possible to hiring managers.  Work with a recruiter.  Specialized staffing professionals have access to positions you might never find on your own.  Meet with an IT recruiter to discuss the type of role you can reasonably expect to find with your current level of education and experience, as well as what you can do to increase your odds of landing an entry-level tech job.

Author Gerald Murphy Date published February 17, 2016 Categories Analytics SEO In a recent article right here on SEW, Christopher investigated the manipulation of UK political party autosuggest queries, but what exactly is search engine bias?  Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software.  Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it.  Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	83.85773657727987

Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google’s search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.  But here’s the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google’s algorithm is biased.  Let’s dive into the case study.  Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.

795	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_50_796224832-19	Index size A large index size ensures that (ideally) all content available on the web can be searched and found. A search engine could bias the search results by not or not fully indexing some sites.  Ranking A good ranking ensures that from the billions of pages indexed you receive the most relevant results regarding to your query.  A search engine could bias the search results either by completely filtering the search results from specific sites or by giving it a lower ranking, for all or for specific queries, and thus burying as rarely somebody looks beyond the first two or three results pages.  Auto complete / suggestion / query rewriting Search engines assist the user in completing and refining their search queries, which ultimately influences the search results which are returned to the user.  A search engine could bias the search results by blocking certain suggestions or by proposing different suggestions.  Political preference of search engines companies and search engine employees Whether and to which extent specific search engine results are politically biased is not known, but there are data available about the political preference of companies and employees.

797	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_52_258700460-2	Quality bias means that the searcher will subconsciously take into account surrounding results and if they’re not relevant our behaviour can change, we may decide to retype our query or inspect a site we otherwise would not have dreamt of. This is precisely the reason why engines have quality scores for their paid search systems, if paid results are irrelevant this can mess with organic result inspection.  For the most part search algorithms are generally very effective at presenting us with relevant results so we trust the engine, this is known as trust bias.  Personalisation through cookies and the creation of 3D cubes are used to increase relevancy.  While there are many advantages of personalisation, personalisation restricts results and is a form of search engine bias.  2) Result manipulation Political and social bias came to the fore in 2002 when Google was temporarily blocked in China and since then, with the USA’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act, indexes and results have always been filtered to comply a little better with the law.  Let’s now take this the other way around, is search engine coverage biased along national lines?  In short, yes.  Engines do not have proportional coverage of a particular group of websites or regions.  But why is this?  Well, country population differences and internet penetration cause unintentional bias.	79.4449208881706

Ideologies are found in every political manifestation (us/them - “we are right, they have got it wrong” or even “we are good, they are evil”) every religion (God say “ABC …, we do ABC … but others do XYZ … - they are damned to Hell, this is good because ABC …”) and that is why all politicians are dangerous, and all religious people are dangerous, and yes, I know, they are all seeking to bring virtue, and correct conduct, and right thinking, and the truth, and salvation, and A and B and C and a whole lot more - because you need such things which you manifestly lack now so We, the enlightened Few, must show you the way to live, and move, and have your being - because we know and you , quite obviously, do not: peasants !

So yes, I don’t think highly of “idealism” nor romanticism.  To me, these are personal flaws.  And now let me share with you a dirty little secret: We’re all idealistic to some degree, myself included.  We all have our very own personal ideology, so to speak.  It’s a very human quality and a very insidious aspect of our psyche.  So the best way to act if you want to avoid ideologies hurting you is to stop buying into your own narratives.  Always question your own ideas and motives.  Avoid identifying with them.  Don’t surrender to group pressure.  Always ask yourself if you’re the good guy.  And most of all, try to embrace truth and reality and get away from self-delusion.  It’s not an easy task at all.  Good luck!	84.57811564975418

Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	83.85773657727987

We Analyzed 50 Key Politically-Driven Topics to Find Out June 13, 2020 June 12, 2020 by Nathan Gotch Is Google biased against conservatives?  The short answer is not likely.  Based on our data-driven study, we found that 63% of Google’s search results were non-partisan.  While 32% of the results came from left-leaning publications versus 5% of results coming from right-leaning websites.  Now you may see 32% vs 5% and think that Google is biased.  But here’s the truth: The lopsided results are because of Search Engine Optimization (SEO), not because Google’s algorithm is biased.  Let’s dive into the case study.  Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.  Websites that present facts.  Not opinions.  This is super important for politically-driven topics where there tends to be lots of misinformation or “ fake news ”.	77.17614785861224

KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.

MARCO_14_257204425-5	Advantages of Search Neutrality Search results would be more relevant to users and not biased towards sites with more ads Neutral search results emphasize higher quality content over paid ranking Allows for manipulation of search results by an objective algorithm, rather than allowing ranking on an individual basis. Search neutrality minimizes the effects of cultural or ideological “ filter bubbles “.  Disadvantages of Search Neutrality Search bias allows “personalized” search results, people want this bias because it delivers smarter, more predictive results.  Search neutrality minimizes this bias and “personalization”.  Regulating search engines and their results could limit a search engine’s ability to adjust rankings based on their own metrics.  Search Engines Without Tracking Minimize Search Bias Search bias is introduced in two ways.  One is from the search engine’s algorithm side, if it determines that a website is generally clicked on more than others.  The other way happens when a search engine monitors a person’s internet behavior and tailors the results based on their past searches and resulting clicks.  Private search engines that don’t track your searches can’t customize your search results.  If you are seeking unbiased information, this is a good thing.  The convenience of personalized results is countered by the “ filter bubble ” effect this creates.	93.59432557995648

Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant.  But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble.""  This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you.

We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience.  1.  Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode.  In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account.  This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results.

MARCO_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines). There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	82.93731084605679

821	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_52_258700460-2	Quality bias means that the searcher will subconsciously take into account surrounding results and if they’re not relevant our behaviour can change, we may decide to retype our query or inspect a site we otherwise would not have dreamt of. This is precisely the reason why engines have quality scores for their paid search systems, if paid results are irrelevant this can mess with organic result inspection.  For the most part search algorithms are generally very effective at presenting us with relevant results so we trust the engine, this is known as trust bias.  Personalisation through cookies and the creation of 3D cubes are used to increase relevancy.  While there are many advantages of personalisation, personalisation restricts results and is a form of search engine bias.  2) Result manipulation Political and social bias came to the fore in 2002 when Google was temporarily blocked in China and since then, with the USA’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act, indexes and results have always been filtered to comply a little better with the law.  Let’s now take this the other way around, is search engine coverage biased along national lines?  In short, yes.  Engines do not have proportional coverage of a particular group of websites or regions.  But why is this?  Well, country population differences and internet penetration cause unintentional bias.	79.4449208881706

This could show a bias because people have opinions - more people might click on one result that they agree with more than the other.  Your mention of autocomplete is not bias either.  It is based on what people actually search - search engines do not just decide what goes in the autocomplete list arbitrarily.  So, in a sense search engines are unintentionally biased towards what the majority think, because this is what powers their results.

Of course, Google recently did decide that people shouldn’t be searching for things, in the case of online piracy, when it began blocking terms it deemed to be piracy-related in January.  That took out — and continues to take out — suggestions for some sites that may also be used for legitimate reasons.  To be clear, suggestions were removed, not the sites themselves.  Want to read the Wikileaks files directly?  BitTorrent or uTorrent have software that will allow you to do this.  But today, Google won’t auto-suggest their names as you begin to type, deeming them too piracy related.  Aside from taking out some potentially innocent parties, the whole thing feels kind of hypocritical.  Why does Google feel it needs to go over-and-above to protect searchers piracy-related suggestions when there are a range of other potential harmful ones out there?  The answer, in my view, is that this is a PR battle Google wants to win as studios and networks accuse it of supporting piracy and seek to enlist the aid of the US Congress.	87.88241685857065

Four years before it was considered stable, the feature was developed in 2004 by Google engineer Kevin Gibbs and the name was chosen by Marissa Mayer.  Google, and other large search companies, maintain a blacklist that prevents the display of queries that could be interpreted as violating their social responsibility.  Despite this, the company regularly receives complaints that several popular suggestions, or suggestions whose positions have been inflated by bots, should be added to this list.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Jillian York has criticized Apple's blacklist for including words that are merely provocative.   One example of a project using suggested queries to expose societal attitudes was a 2013 ad series called ""The Autocomplete Truth"" by UN Women.  The campaign showed several gender stereotypes being displayed as popular searches by Google Suggest.  Another was a story by Bad Astronomy that revealed a distrustful perspective on scientists in the suggestion box.  Additionally, cases related to libel laws have posited that suggestions may inspire people to associate specific names with specific alleged crimes when they would not have otherwise.   Some users have criticized the fact that suggestion-enabled text boxes, unlike the web forms of static HTML, send data about each keystroke to a central server."	86.89153689841623
828	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly. The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found.  These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color.  For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests.  One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence.  Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms.  But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology.  Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people.  Take cannabis arrests, for just one example.  Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	88.57247802056372

The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.  Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender.  Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles.  Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.

Johnson reports. The findings highlight the ubiquity of racial biases in the algorithms that help shape even the most critical areas of our lives.  While the study focused on just one tool from a company called Optum, bias probably exists in tools across the private and public sectors that help manage the health care of more than 200 million Americans, researchers reported in the journal Science.  “It’s truly inconceivable to me that anyone else’s algorithm doesn’t suffer from this,” said Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of computation and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who oversaw the research.  “I’m hopeful that this causes the entire industry to say, ‘Oh, my, we’ve got to fix this.’ ”  Optum is working on a fix that could more than double the number of black patients the algorithm can identify, but it’s hard to say how many algorithms for medical care have similar issues since their inner workings are often shielded from researchers.  Some lawmakers have even introduced legislation to force companies to take accountability for such biases — intentional or not.	76.12420526705682

This means you have to know how these algorithim-based systems work and how to get your high school resume past the digital filter.  They are designed to eliminate “unsuitable” resumes before they ever get seen by a hiring manager.  Whether an applicant's resume is perceived as a good fit is initially determined by a ""bot,"" not a person.  Employers programs the software to screen for certain skills and attributes reflected in keywords and phrases.  The ATS scans resumes on that basis, then, scores and ranks them based on how many keywords and phrases appear (as well as other factors).  Your resume will only make the cut if it is in the top ranking range.  That means it is vital for you to use those keywords in your high school resume.  Also pay special attention to formal requirements indicated in the job listing such as city, contact information, age, etc.  Now you may be wondering, how do I fit those skill keywords in with no experience?

The use of Applicant Tracking Systems has increased dramatically in the last few years: as shown in the image above, over 95% of large companies and over 50% of mid-sized companies use an ATS.  So what does the ATS look for in your resume?  The ATS algorithm scans for keywords that are related to the advertised job.  It also scans for information related to your work experience and education.  If the ATS determines that your resume is a good match for the position, it gives you a high ranking.  This ranking improves your chances of being seen by a recruiter and ultimately landing the interview.  Here is a popular ATS resume analyzer called Taleo, which demonstrates how an employer sees candidates for a particular job opening: As you can see, the ATS judges the candidates to the best-matched position and are given a higher ranking.  Why is it so important to optimize your resume for an ATS?  Your resume is up against a lot, so optimizing your resume for ATS scans will give you the best chance of getting noticed by an employer.

Subsequently, it will scan for specific keywords and phrases.  Where do these keywords come from?  Yep, you guessed it right.  The job description.  Like we earlier stated, almost all the words in a JD can be construed as keywords that can be used by an HR to screen and shortlist candidates.  The ATS will break down your resume into individual categories: Education, Contact Information, Skills and Work Experience.  The desired skills and keywords are then matched against your resume to determine your potential value to the organization.  Resumes with the highest scores relevant to the specified keywords/phrases will be moved up for further review.  Now you know how it broadly works.  But how to trick the ATS into ranking you higher than everybody else?  The answer to that can range from tiny pointers to a comprehensive breakdown of your resume in accordance with ATS requirements.  Do away with the headers.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user’s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: ""  [  T]he phrase “search-engine bias” has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.

Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software.  Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it.  Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	83.85773657727987

837	149_3-1	How do you get impartial results from search engines?	KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.  And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.   Search neutrality became a concern after search engines, most notably Google, were accused of search bias by other companies.  Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.   The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.  Sites like Amazon.com and Facebook are also accused of skewing results."	91.68614597272244

Search neutrality minimizes this bias and “personalization”.  Regulating search engines and their results could limit a search engine’s ability to adjust rankings based on their own metrics.  Search Engines Without Tracking Minimize Search Bias Search bias is introduced in two ways.  One is from the search engine’s algorithm side, if it determines that a website is generally clicked on more than others.  The other way happens when a search engine monitors a person’s internet behavior and tailors the results based on their past searches and resulting clicks.

There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.
