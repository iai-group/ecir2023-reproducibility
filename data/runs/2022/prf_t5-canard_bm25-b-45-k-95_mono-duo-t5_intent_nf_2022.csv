On 28 May 2020, the COP Bureau decided that it would take place from 1-12 November 2021, in Glasgow, UK.  The change in dates had been anticipated following a decision, on 1 April 2020, to postpone the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  At that time, the COP Bureau announced that: “In light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible.  Rescheduling will ensure all parties can focus on the issues to be discussed at this vital conference and allow more time for the necessary preparations to take place.  We will continue to work with all involved to increase climate ambition, build resilience and lower emissions.”  The Italy-hosted Pre-COP and 'Youth for the Climate' event are also postponed.

9	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_50_573981595-1	"Climate Change - Rising Temperature | PublicHealth.org Health Guides Climate Change Climate change is one of the most fiercely debated scientific issues of the past 20 years.  Although a steady contingent of global warming deniers have remained insistent that climate change does not pose a threat, there is an overwhelming consensus among the worldwide scientific community that our planet is undergoing significant, highly problematic shifts.  Experts point to rising sea levels, record-breaking temperatures across the globe, declining air quality and erratic weather patterns as different manifestations of climate change.  Today, doctors, nurses and other medical personnel are drawing attention to the negative effects on human health caused by an increasingly warm, more heavily polluted environment.  According to a 2009 article in Scientific American, a team of climate change researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) found that ""global warming is [  responsible] for some 150,000 deaths each year around the world""; they feared this number would double by the year 2030.  Climate change fatalities are generally linked to four different catalysts: Rising temperatures Declining air quality Extreme weather Vector-borne illnesses This guide discusses all four of these factors at length.  Our goal is to create a comprehensive health resource that will help you, your loved ones, and your community safeguard against diseases, conditions, and injuries stemming from climate change."	83.45013450994156
10	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	WAPO_F4ED6VDOMJBVJALYX4Q4T6GCJA-1	As head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that rising levels of carbon dioxide from human-fueled activity are warming the planet.  He’s now taking a different tack: Even if climate change is occurring, as the vast majority of scientists say it is, a warmer atmosphere might not be so awful for humans, according to Pruitt.  “We know humans have most flourished during times of what, warming trends,” Pruitt said Tuesday during an interview on KSNV, an NBC affiliate in Las Vegas.  “So I think there’s assumptions made that because the climate is warming, that that necessarily is a bad thing.   Do we really know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100, in the year 2018?  That’s fairly arrogant for us to think that we know exactly what it should be in 2100.”  Pruitt continued: “There are very important questions around the climate issue that folks really don’t get to.  And that’s one of the reasons why I’ve talked about having an honest, open, transparent debate about what do we know, what don’t we know, so the American people can be informed and they can make decisions on their own with respect to these issues.”	80.46169609937351
11	132_1-7	Woah. The effects of climate change are not all bad, right?	MARCO_21_590083193-1	Solar Power: Good for the Environment and Human Health | by Brooklyn Faulkner | Healthcare in America Solar Power: Good for the Environment and Human Health Brooklyn Faulkner Follow Mar 23, 2019 · 5 min read Source: Unsplash In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  While the consequences of an increase in temperature by 1.5 degrees are not as bad as those expected with an increase of 2 degrees, the environment will still suffer considerably.  Some of the potential risks of a 1.5 degree increase include climate-related risks to health, livelihood, food security, water supply, and economic growth.  Unfortunately, these human-associated risks of rising temperatures and climate change only scratch the surface of larger environmental repercussions of rising temperatures and climate change.  Vanishing ecosystems, species extinction, and rising sea levels are all expected outcomes of the changing planet.  If limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees still results in dire consequences, one can only imagine the havoc a rise of 2 degrees would cause.  Today, it is more important than ever to make efforts to minimize climate change and ensure the least possible damage to the planet.  One way to do so is by replacing traditional energy sources with solar power.	79.95105359179433

16	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_47_1570533441-15	As part of an international agreement signed at the conference, all 27 member states of the European Union agreed to reduce carbon emission s by 20 percent by 2020 (from 1990 levels). The EU also notified the UN of a “conditional offer to increase this cut to 30 percent, provided that other major emitters agree to take on their fair share of a global reduction effort.”  This conditional offer illustrates the tension that was present at the conference between developed countries’ high carbon emissions and developing countries’ low or rising carbon use.  In fact, many developing nations argued that the Copenhagen Accord was drafted by a small group of powerful countries and unfairly disadvantages poorer countries, many of which are expected to suffer the worst effects of climate change.  The ageing of Europe’s population is also expected to dramatically affect the continent’s social, political, and financial future.  The overall population of Europe is set to drop from roughly 590 million to 542 million by 2050.  The proportion of people older than 65 will grow from 16 percent to 28 percent.  These projected changes will have two major effects: There will be a smaller work force to create a dynamic and industrious economy, and governments and citizens will have to care for more elderly people.  These changes will affect different regions of Europe in different ways.	87.96130669940612
17	132_2-3	Okay, but how does climate change affect developing countries?	MARCO_18_3480200950-24	The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history.  Currently climate change is affecting the global community in each country of the world.  Its impact affects not only national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions.  By 2018, climate change continued exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods, affecting more than 39 million of people.  Over the period 2000–2018, green house emissions of developed countries and economies in transitions have declined by 6.5%.  The emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013.  In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.  Plastic polymers are derived from fossil fuels and plastics account for 6% of global oil consumption.  Therefore, plastics and GHG emissions are intricately connected with every step of the plastic life cycle, from production to transportation to waste disposal, contributing to climate change.	83.28391611165989
18	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1250272123-2	To provide predictability on climate finance, developed countries will communicate every two years on projected levels of public climate finance to be provided to developing countries. Developing countries will report on climate finance they will provide on a voluntary basis.  Regular updates send a signal for where low-carbon investments can be made, and the resources available to help the most vulnerable communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Broadening the donor base The broadening of the donor pool is important, because it recognizes the fact that many developing countries are already contributing climate finance.  Countries that were considered low-income developing countries several decades ago are now in a position which allows them to contribute climate finance for less developed countries.  Countries including Vietnam and Chile have already pledged funds to the Green Climate Fund, and China has pledged $3.1 billion for South-South cooperation between developing countries.  The new Agreement makes clear that developed countries are not shirking their responsibilities for climate finance --- which is a responsibility already recognized as part of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  Developing countries are not obligated to provide climate finance, but they are welcomed to contribute financing for climate activities without diluting the responsibilities of developed nations to provide climate finance.	84.03942359890789
19	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_48_1251187189-9	Countries are also expected to revisit their pledges and put forward progressively stronger targets every five years, with the goal of further driving down emissions. Nations must participate in a “ global stocktake ” to measure collective efforts toward meeting the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals as well.  Meanwhile, developed countries also have to estimate how much financial assistance they’ll allocate to developing nations to help them reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  These transparency and accountability provisions are similar to those in the frameworks of other international agreements.  While the system doesn’t include financial penalties, the requirements are aimed at making the progress of individual nations easy to track and fostering a sense of global peer pressure, discouraging any dragging of feet among countries that may consider doing so.  Mobilize support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in developing nations.  Recognizing that many developing countries and small island nations that have contributed the least to climate change could suffer the most from its consequences, the Paris Agreement includes a plan for developed countries—and others “in a position to do so”—to continue to provide financial resources to help developing countries mitigate and increase resilience to climate change.	81.64089118689299
20	132_2-5	How are developed countries helping developing countries adapt to climate change?	MARCO_15_1888001823-3	Adaptation Governments agreed to strengthen societies' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change; provide continued and enhanced international support for adaptation to developing countries. Loss and damage The agreement also recognises the importance of averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; acknowledges the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.  Role of cities, regions and local authorities The agreement recognises the role of non-Party stakeholders in addressing climate change, including cities, other subnational authorities, civil society, the private sector and others.  They are invited to scale up their efforts and support actions to reduce emissions; build resilience and decrease vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change; uphold and promote regional and international cooperation.  Support The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries.  Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year by 2020 and extend this until 2025.  A new and higher goal will be set for after this period.	81.40631473995745

22	132_2-7	Are developed countries meeting their pledges to provide climate financial support to developing countries in the Paris Agreement?	MARCO_48_1250292652-5	For this reason the Paris agreement sets out a clear signal that developed countries will help mobilize even greater financial support to assist the poorest countries in building low-carbon and climate resilient economies. The agreement outlines that developed countries will continue to support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.  Other countries can help mobilize finance to assist developing countries (see Art 9.1-9.3).  Developed countries signal that they will continue with their existing finance goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020.  And they outlined that before 2025 they will set a new collective financial target from a floor of $100 billion per year (to regularly outline significantly more finance that they will mobilize, starting with the $100 billion in 2020 as the floor (see para 54 in the Decision).

Giving confidence that existing financial commitments will be met:Many developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, came to Paris seeking reassurance that a global climate deal is not just about the big emitters but also supports their transition to a low-carbon growth path.  In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.  These components of the Agreement build on steps the United States took in Paris to demonstrate its commitment to mobilizing finance from public and private sources for both mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries.	83.07114095520228

Delegates from almost 200 countries had hoped to put the finishing touches on the rules governing the 2015 Paris accord, ironing out a few wrinkles left over from last year’s conference in Katowice, Poland, and setting the scene for a major review of their efforts in 2020.  But a year ago, Brazil pulled its offer to host the talks, and last month, stand-in Chile, rattled by anti-government protests, canceled five weeks before the meeting.  Next, President Trump served formal notice that the United States was quitting the Paris accord, delivering a symbolic blow to one of his predecessor’s signature achievements.  And scientists?  Well, they didn’t have any good news, either.  Study after study published in recent months has underscored the rapid pace of global warming and the need to urgently cut emissions of greenhouse gases.  Against that backdrop, the Dec. 2-13 meeting in Madrid has gained fresh impetus.  “We have to do more in less time,” said Spain’s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, whose country stepped in to host the talks.	84.69878603779307

29	132_2-11	So what happens at each Conference of Parties?	MARCO_39_196501676-20	During the annual Conference of the Parties (COP), nations share information on emissions, policies, and practices, and attempt to develop strategies for addressing climate change. The IPCC consults experts to assess climate change science and presents policy-relevant information outlining how nations can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impact and risks of this global threat.  In 1997, the members of the UNFCCC negotiated the Kyoto Protocol, a legally binding agreement that compelled developed nations to reduce greenhouse emissions over the course of two commitment periods (2008-2012 and 2013-2020).  At the 2015 Conference of the Parties, countries adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change.  The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016, less than a year after it was adopted.  As of August 2020, 189 parties (188 countries plus the European Union) have ratified the Paris Agreement.  The parties agree to limit global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” (3.6 Fahrenheit) this century.  Participating countries are expected to submit their own country-specific emission reduction targets, known as Nationally Determined Contributions.  In 2015, the United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are meant to serve as a blueprint for action on critical development issues, such as ending poverty and hunger.	90.24147696124555
30	132_2-13	How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?	MARCO_54_276512227-6	And would the rich world be defined strictly as the U.S., the EU, Canada, and Japan? The United States preferred for China and India—two wealthy, powerful nations that also contain hundreds of millions of people still in poverty—to pitch into that $100 billion target.  Yet even as those two Asian nations talked up their own investment in climate-vulnerable nations, they blanched at being compelled to join the rich world’s pledge.  The solution: So here’s something counter-intuitive.  The text commonly called the “Paris Agreement” is actually two different documents: the agreement itself, which is legally binding, and the Paris decision, which passes the agreement and sets out a number of less legally binding ways to approach and observe it.  The Paris agreement includes no new specific commitments to finance.  But item 115 of the Paris decision says that more than that $100 billion will be needed:  *  *  * How often should nations check and reassess their emission reductions?  The problem: Two different mechanisms apply here.  The first is stock-taking, when countries will announce how they’ve reduced carbon emissions.  The draft Paris agreement now says global stock-takes will take place every five years.	92.00606719014456
31	132_2-13	How are the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement different?	WAPO_MFJTN65BNZCQTCCG5CUTO6SJOM-1	The latest round of global climate negotiations just concluded in the coal city of Katowice, Poland.  This was the 24th meeting of the “conference of the parties” (COP) to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change — and the most important meeting since COP 21, the 2015 Paris agreement.    What was at stake?  This year’s negotiations were about finalizing the “Paris rule book” — and they somewhat miraculously did, with an accord on the rules finally reached Saturday.  The Paris agreement ushered in a different approach to reducing greenhouse gases, after previous false starts.  Unlike the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, where diplomats collectively negotiated emissions-reduction targets, the Paris agreement asked countries to come forward with their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — their best offers of emissions reductions they thought they could achieve.  Alongside these voluntary commitments were mandatory requirements on reporting and transparency.  In Katowice, negotiators sought to finalize the rules governing those requirements.  The theory was that the international system has weak compliance mechanisms — so the best hope is for countries to figure out what they can do, get started and raise their ambition over time.	91.76972122406808

The United Kingdom will hold a major international climate summit in Glasgow in November — considered the most significant gathering of world leaders since the 2015 climate meeting in Paris — and Britain is keen to strengthen its claim to leadership in the area, especially as it prepares for its place on the world stage post-Brexit.  Johnson officially began COP26, as the climate talks are known, at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday.  Appearing alongside revered British naturalist David Attenborough, the prime minister declared that Britain, as the “first country to industrialize,” has a “responsibility to lead the way.”  Johnson urged other countries to match Britain’s pledge — made by his predecessor Theresa May last year — to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.  He also announced that Britain will ban new gas, diesel and hybrid cars by 2035, cutting the current target of 2040 by five years.

Following Trump's announcement, the governors of several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to continue to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal.

The Paris Agreement was an addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), initially agreed to by all 195 countries present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December of that year, including the United States then under the presidency of Barack Obama.  Due to the status of the United States and China as the greatest emitters of carbon dioxide, Obama's support and his cooperation with China were seen as major factors leading to the convention's early success.	75.4525044709444

This has not been the case across the entire current administration, Biden explained, but in a number of areas, “the professionals are at a loss” to explain where things stand.  Chaos and lack of clarity are hobbling the current administration and are making the transition particularly difficult.  “I can’t tell if I have a clear view of where the landmines are,” Biden confessed.

The United States, in this scenario, would have to go from lowering its emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 (its current goal), to cutting them by 45 percent by 2030.  Other nations would have to make similarly large improvements on what they are currently promising to do.  And even then, due to scientific uncertainty, the planet could still conceivably overshoot 2 degrees, and there is only a 66 percent or greater chance of getting there.  Of course, the actual embraced goal of the world is to stay “well below” 2 degrees, a target that suggests prudent avoidance, not walking right up to it and potentially going over.  Accordingly, the study also examined what it would take to suppress emissions fast enough to hit 1.5 degrees C. Here we’d have to have global emissions peak in 2020 and then decline by 5.9 percent annually thereafter.  The United States, here, would have to get its emissions 60 percent below their 2005 levels by 2030.  This is extreme, but then, that’s what it would take.  If we want to buy time, we have to save forests.   There’s some good news here.	77.87127968296409
44	132_3-7	How is Biden's administration doing in regards to achieving its emissions targets?	WAPO_9b671b670858ecbdcbed88126425856d-4	Many factors will play a role, such as the shares of natural gas and coal in the electricity sector, as well as energy efficiency investments that drive down demand. However, we estimate that the U.S. can achieve the majority share of its original 2025 emissions reduction target even with federal policy changes.  More ambitious state policies would further compensate for changes at the federal level.  On the basis of these numbers alone, it’s clear that the United States will continue to contribute to clean energy market expansion and emissions reduction even with changes to federal policy.  Additionally, several states are well positioned to increase their clean energy ambition to keep the U.S. mostly on track to meeting its near-term clean energy commitments, and to keep longer-term emissions goals – not yet implemented in policy – within reach.  Moreover, many countries are likely to stick to their climate plans.  China, which represents more than one third of the expected solar PV and wind capacity growth between now and 2030, has indicated it plans to do so.  The EU commitment looks strong as well.  The demand created in China, the EU, and India – together accounting for over 50 percent of global solar PV and wind capacity additions by 2030 – argues for companies to stay competitive in these markets.	73.6881566918455

A Pampering Kit For Her Hands Or Feet We moms often neglect taking time out to pamper ourselves.  Help make it easier for us by creating a pampering kit for our nails or feet as a gift.  Include clippers, files, pumice stones, scrubs, creams, soaking agents, and of course a new pot of nail polish.  Place it all inside a cosmetic tote so it stays together, making it easy to grab when mom has 15 minutes to herself.  17.  A Game And A Promise Got a mom who loves an evening spent playing cards or board games?  Grab her a new game and promise to come over one night and play a few rounds with her.  I am a mom who loves this and I have Bananagrams on my Christmas list this year.  18.  New Winter Accessory Items If your mom is absent-minded like me, she probably loses at least one winter weather accessory a year whether it be a hat, gloves or a scarf.  If not, sometimes it is just nice to update these items to the latest styles such as a blanket scarf.  19.	79.71155878296122
47	133_1-1	I’d like to appreciate my mum by making her a beauty pamper pack. What do you put in one?	MARCO_51_1542142755-2	I love Mother’s day, don’t you? All moms deserve a bit of pampering for Mother’s Day, so this year I decided to put together a little something for all the Moms in the family.  One of my favorite gifts to give for this type of occasion is gift baskets.  Gift Baskets are a great gift option for when you need to put together multiple items or want to personalize the gift for a specific recipient or theme.  Plus I just love being able to pick and choose my favorite goodies to include.  Since this gift basket is for Mother’s Day, I went with the theme of “pampering” and selected just a few of my favorite at-home pampering and beauty products to give.  I especially love the eos line of lip balms and lotions, and I wanted to make sure to include a few items from their Limited Edition Spring Packs in my basket.  To round out the basket, I included a few other pampering products in coordinating, brightly colored packaging.  Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links.

There’s no better way to do this than with beauty products!  If you know what her favorites are, you can fill her basket with those.  Otherwise, just select things that are universal, such as body cream and bubble bath.  Try making your own beauty products to make the gift even more special!  New Interests Has your mom expressed a desire to learn a new skill?  If so, Mother’s Day is the perfect time to show your support by giving her everything she needs to get started.  For example, if she wants to learn how to play the guitar you can make a basket that has guitar picks, a guitar tuner, a chord book, and an instructional DVD.  Voucher Booklets Mother’s Day is not only a time to honor mothers, but also a chance to give them a break.  Sure, you can do all her chores on Mother’s Day, but what about during the rest of the year?  Vouchers are a nice addition to her gift basket because she can redeem them anytime she wants!  Making dinner, cleaning the house, and running errands all make for great voucher items.	97.87873229365732

DIY Makeup Remover Wipes I’ve written about the dangers of conventional baby wipes and why I make my own.  Conventional, store-bought makeup removing wipes pose the same problems: chemical preservatives and other hormone disrupting, unnatural ingredients.  Making your own makeup remover wipes is easy though!  To make DIY makeup remover wipes: You’ll need: a pint-sized jar with a tight-fitting lid cotton rounds 1 TBSP pure aloe vera 3 tsp pure witch hazel extract 1 tsp liquid castile soap ( Dr. Bronner’s Baby Mild is a perfect choice.) 1 tsp fractionated coconut oil (or your favorite skin-cleansing oil) 8-12 drops skin-soothing essential oil like lavender or frankincense optional: 1 tsp vitamin E oil or 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil as a preservative To make: Combine everything but the cotton rounds in the jar and shake or use an immersion blender to combine well.  Stack the cotton rounds in the jar, then gently shake it to coat them with the mixture.  Use a cotton round to wipe your makeup off anytime you need a quick DIY makeup remover.  The cleansing wipes are great for traveling!	93.73177662922262
52	133_1-5	I’ve never made a beauty product at home before. Can you tell me how to make one?	MARCO_23_1171176538-4	Witch hazel is an easy-to-source, natural ingredient that’s also used as an astringent in skincare routines. For this recipe, I recommend using an alcohol-free witch hazel so it doesn’t dry out your skin.  To make this makeup remover, combine 3 tablespoons of alcohol-free witch hazel and 2 tablespoons of nourishing oil (like olive oil).  Before each use, shake the bottle.  To use this makeup remover, apply a small amount of oil to a cotton ball or facial pad, and then gently wipe the face with the moistened pad.  Once your makeup has been removed, wash your face with a cleanser.  I’m currently using this cleanser .  If you’d like a soapy cleanser, I’ve also used this honey face wash recipe.  Pros Lasts a few months.  Great for someone who doesn’t want to use 100% oil on their face.  Another perk of this recipe is that you can use the basic concept to make reusable face wipes, which are very handy if you travel!  Cons Since this recipe is very liquid-y, it’s easy to use a bit too much and get some in your eye (s).  Not that I know anything about this from experience ;).	88.98699778812534

If you want to learn how to make your own DIY face makeup remover, there are step-by-step instructions below!  I have tried a lot of homemade makeup removers.  My go-to is generally the Oil Cleansing Method, but sometimes I am admittedly lazy, and want to be able to remove my makeup while watching tv on the couch.  You feel me, right?  I find that makeup remover wipes are highly convenient for such times, and will occasionally find myself buying them at the store.  But there are two things that bother me when buying makeup remover wipes: they’re expensive, and they contain unnecessary chemicals that dry out my facial skin.  (Not trying to call out any specific companies here, but one “ultra-calming” makeup remover I’ve tried contains isononyl isononanoate, pentaerythrityl tetraethylhexanoate, cetyl ethylhexanoate, and 20 more ingredients.  In a makeup remover.  It’s crazy!)  A few years ago, it occurred to me that I could make my own homemade makeup remover wipes!	88.8849686519552
54	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1398117145-7	Expert Tip When you switch to a natural men’s deodorant, there may be an adjustment period during which you sweat more and notice increased odor. It usually only lasts a couple of days, but some men may experience the issue for up to a few weeks.  STAFF BestReviews Men’s deodorant prices Men’s deodorants vary in price based mainly on the type of the ingredients, but you’ll typically pay between $3 and $48.  Inexpensive Men’s deodorants that solely provide odor protection are usually the least expensive option, ranging from $3 to $7.  Men’s antiperspirant deodorant products are usually a bit more expensive, and typically cost between $5 and $10.  Mid-range You’ll usually pay more for men’s deodorants that contain natural ingredients too – all-natural formulas usually range from $6 to $22.  Expensive The most expensive men’s deodorant options are those that coordinate with designer colognes.  These can be either deodorant only or antiperspirant deodorant formulas, but you’ll usually pay between $22 and $48.  Tips Always apply deodorant to dry skin for the most effective odor protection.  Wear shirts that fit loosely under the arms so air can circulate in your armpits and they will be less likely to sweat.	93.90952066440876
55	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_12_1385660336-6	Moisturizing Gentle on sensitive skin Applied with fingers Can feel sticky at first Natural Natural deodorants use baking soda, salt crystals, or essential oils to combat sweat and odor. All-natural products No aluminum salts, parabens, or other chemicals Come in stick, spray, cream, and solid “crystal” forms Scented or unscented Not necessarily hypoallergenic (Essential oils can cause itching, irritation, or skin rashes.)  Did you know?  Most deodorants have fragrance, so choose one that complements your perfume or just smells nice.  Also check any reactions to your skin before you buy one.  STAFF BestReviews Women’s deodorant prices There are deodorants for women that cost from $5 to $20 and more, but there’s no reason to spend more than a few dollars.  While you can certainly spend more – there are designer, specialty, and natural products that cost more than $20 – most women can find an effective deodorant at the drugstore that costs about $5.  Tips Cover your entire underarm area.  Many women just swipe the deodorant up and down a couple of times without coming in contact all of the skin in their armpits.  Apply deodorant at bedtime.	85.85087771179678
56	133_1-7	How much would making my own deodorant cost?	MARCO_45_622525419-2	Keep in mind that even all-natural or organic deodorants include ingredients that can harm you when absorbed into your bloodstream. Also, follow the directions on the deodorant.  Crystal stone deodorants, for example, require that you wet the stone before applying it as a deodorant.  Where to Buy Some deodorants, including the Dr. Hauschka and Weleda brands, are available only online or through high-end retailers.  Burt’s Bees and Arm & Hammer both make natural, aluminum-free deodorants that are sold in grocery stores, discount stores, drugstores and pharmacies.  Some products are also available from beauty supply stores.  If you decide to shop online, look for stores that offer free or discount shipping.  Cost While some aluminum-free deodorants cost up to $30, others are available for $5 or less.  The Weleda and Dr. Hauschka products are at the higher end of the spectrum, retailing for around $25 as of 2010.  Crystal Stone deodorants are a mid-priced option, retailing for around $10 to $15.  The company behind the Crystal Stone deodorant also makes a smaller and cheaper travel size, so you can test the product before committing to one of the larger sizes.	85.75510005014075
57	133_3-2	My mum loves a good, scented lotion. Let’s make that	MARCO_38_279071407-6	For an oily, irritated scalp, you can add mint or eucalyptus oil. Lotion Using homemade lotion is great when you are trying to avoid harmful chemicals.  Your mom’s skin will need a lotion that moisturizes and tightens the skin.  An easy lotion recipe is using 100 percent natural aloe gel and whipping in an oil of your liking.  You can use pure, edible coconut oil.  Another effective option is using edible cocoa butter.  Add pomegranate seed oil to enhance the lotion’s anti-aging property.  If your mom has oily skin or sensitive skin, you can add tea tree oil or rosemary oil.  Check out this customizable homemade face mask recipe.  Toner A good, homemade toner will make your mother’s skin happy.  A base product that goes well with all skin types is rose water.  You can add other ingredients to enhance its properties.  For sensitive skin, add witch hazel extract to the toner.  For acne-prone skin, add tea tree oil.  You can make tea tree water by mixing water with oil.  If your mom has dry skin, make sure to add coconut oil to your toner.

60	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_47_521703086-1	How to Make Scented Body Lotion - ModernMom How to Make Scented Body Lotion October 11, 2016 by ModernMom Staff Leave a Comment Scented body lotion can be expensive and may contain irritants or allergens.  You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.  Essential oils are extracted from plants and can be less potentially irritating or allergenic.	90.55077488988172
61	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_58_683154701-9	"There’s no need to pay extra for scented body lotions. Instead, choose an unscented lotion, then add 3-4 drops of undiluted lavender oil to the bottle.  If you don’t want the whole bottle of lotion to smell like lavender, dispense a little lotion into your hands, add 1 drop of lavender oil, and rub your hands together to mix it thoroughly.  {""smallUrl"":""https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/8\/8d\/Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg\/v4-460px-Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\/images\/thumb\/8\/8d\/Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg\/aid6902816-v4-728px-Use-Lavender-Oil-Step-11.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":345,""bigWidth"":728,""bigHeight"":546,""licensing"":""<div class=\""mw-parser-output\""><p>License: <a target=\""_blank\"" rel=\""nofollow noreferrer noopener\"" class=\""external text\"" href=\""https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\"">Creative Commons<\/a><br>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><\/div>""} 2 Make a sugar scrub with sugar, undiluted lavender, and oil.

62	133_3-4	I need more information about purchasing an unscented lotion base	MARCO_47_521703086-2	You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries. Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.  Step 4 Pour your lotion into a large mixing bowl.  Add fragrance or essential oil.  Allow for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 oz.  of fragrance or essential oil per 16 oz.  of lotion.  Use a whisk or non-absorbent spoon to mix your lotion thoroughly.  You can also add FDA approved colorants at this time.  Step 5 Use a funnel to bottle your lotion into an easy-to-use pump bottle or another suitable container.  Enjoy your new scented body lotion.  Warnings Choose a good quality lotion to avoid problems with separation and spoilage.	87.7745188283152
63	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_15_1872813287-3	So, if you’re planning to make a fragrance-free lotion or you wish to add essential oils, I would advise using Shea butter instead of the cacao butter which has a strong aroma and will blur the scent of your essential oils. Glycerin or Honey Both are humectants, and they enhance the moisturizing properties of your lotion and will give you an additional protection by binding the moisture onto your skin.  So, if your skin is really dry from the sun, cold weather or air-conditioning, glycerin or honey are an excellent natural way to enrich your lotion.  But be careful not to add too much or you’ll end up with a sticky lotion.  Essential Oils If you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know that I’m a huge fan of essential oils.  Not only for their beautiful fragrance but their benefits as well.  So, go ahead and personalize your lotion with your favorite scent or add some of them to help you fight dry or greasy skin, acne, eczema, etc.  Moreover, jasmine, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, rose, and lavender are all good examples of essential oils for an aging and dry skin.	81.378971837461
64	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_58_105794544-8	You can use a single essential oil or a combination of several—it's completely customizable. If you aren’t sure what scents you like, you might try: Lavender oil for a relaxing, slightly herbal scent Rose oil for a classic floral fragrance Citrus oils like sweet orange and grapefruit for a bright, energetic scent Patchouli or cedarwood oil for a deep, woody scent Myrrh, frankincense, or benzoin for a dramatic, resinous scent Tip: Always use high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oil for your lotion.  Avoid synthetic fragrance oils unless you're sure they won't irritate your skin.  2 Blend the lotion for 1-2 minutes to incorporate the essential oil.  At this point, test the lotion on your hand to see how you like the fragrance.  If you want a slightly stronger scent, add another teaspoon of essential oil and blend the mixture again.  However, avoid using more than a total of 2 teaspoons (6 ml) of essential oil.  Essential oil is very concentrated and can irritate the skin if it isn’t properly diluted.  3 Use skin-safe mica, oxides, and powdered pigments to add color.  These products are oil-soluble, so they're perfect for this recipe.	80.6307214666158
65	133_3-6	What types of essential oils should I consider when making my own scented lotion?	MARCO_24_1169299216-5	The type of essential oils you use will depend on the purpose of the lotion: Peppermint and ginger for cooling massage lotions after exercise. Calendula and chamomile for sensitive skin.  Argan oil and patchouli for anti-aging face creams.  Aqueous vs. Oil Lotions The main difference between a lotion and body butter is how much water is in it.  With most creams, more than half of the tub is water.  When you’re making home-made lotions, the problem with water is that it provides a breeding ground for bacteria and mold.  This means that to keep the lotion fresh, you need to add some sort of preservative.  Some essential oils, such as tea tree, make good preservatives, so if you are planning on adding those to your blend, then that may be enough to preserve a small tub of lotion.  If you don’t want to add preservatives, though, you’re going to struggle.  Body butter is less likely to go rancid quickly, but a lot of people don’t like them because of the texture.  Water-based oils are a good choice for those people, and there are some active ingredients such as rose water, aloe juice, and witch hazel that are water soluble and work well in water-based lotions.	76.76053467392921
66	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_23_881727735-2	Formulation: 90% Cyclomethicone 5% Artisan’s Perfume Base 5% fragrance oil Step 1 Using the Funnel Pitcher and scale, weigh out 8 ounces of Cyclomethicone. Step 2 Measure by weight .40 ounce of body safe Fragrance Oil and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  We used Light Blue type fragrance oil in this recipe.  Usage is 5% of fragrance oil to the Cyclomethicone.  In this tutorial, 5% of 8 ounces is .40 ounces.  Step 3 Add 5% of the Artisan’s Perfume Base.  Weigh out .40 ounce of the Artisan’s Perfume Base and add it to the Cyclomethicone.  The Artisan’s Perfume Base will add a cooling effect to the spray.  Step 4 Stir slowly until fully incorporated.  Cyclomethicone stays completely blended and crystal clear without the need for shaking.  Step 5 Slowly pour the product into 2-ounce Tapered PET Spray bottles.  This tutorial will make four 2-ounce bottles of Dry Oil Spray.  Step 6 Mix and match fragrance oils to come up with a unique scent.  Enjoy!  DIY Crafting Tutorials - spread the love!

67	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_52_1346111477-7	Do not use a stick blender to mix in the fragrance, or the batter may become too thick. Crisp Cotton Fragrance Oil does not accelerate trace in cold process soap.  If you are working with a different fragrance oil that does accelerate trace, add the fragrance oil after adding the colorants.  FIVE:  Split the soap batter into two even containers; it’s okay to eyeball it!  There will be about 3 cups in each container.  SIX: To one container, add all the dispersed Ultramarine Blue Oxide and use a whisk to mix in.  To the other container, add all the dispersed Titanium Dioxide and use a whisk to thoroughly mix in.  SEVEN: Pour about 1/4 of the white soap into the mold.  Tap the mold on the counter gently to release any bubbles.  EIGHT: Pour about 1/4 of the blue soap into the layer of white, moving the soap throughout the mold.  Pour from a few inches above the mold to cause the soap to “break through” into the white.  Don’t worry about making your pour “perfect.”  NINE: Continue to pour the white and blue soap into the mold from various heights.  As you continue to pour, the soap will begin to swirl itself naturally.	82.95982124880902
68	133_3-8	Okay, so how do I mix the unscented lotion and the essential oils?	MARCO_55_59440734-5	With the introduction of stick blenders to soap making, the trace can be reached in a few minutes. The Spruce / David Fisher Add Fragrance or Essential Oils After the soap mixture is completely blended, but before it gets too thick, slowly add any fragrance or essential oils from your recipe to the mixture.  Stop stick blending the mixture and just use the end of the stick blender like a spoon.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Additives or Extras If your recipe calls for additives such as spices, natural exfoliants, flower petals, herbs, or special moisturizing oils, now is the time to add them.  As you did with the fragrance, gently stir them into the pot using the stick blender as a spoon.  Before you move on to adding the colorant, give the mixture a brief blend with the stick blender to make sure that the fragrance oil and additives are well mixed.  The Spruce / David Fisher Add Color to the Soap Next, add color to the soap.  If you want the soap to be one single color, add the colorant to the pot and stir.  If you want to achieve a swirl effect, do the following: Ladle about 1/2 to 1 cup of the soap mixture into a measuring cup.  Add the colorant to that bit of soap.	81.31301284479923

MARCO_34_552141024-6	Step 1: Prep Fabric To make the DIY makeup remover pads, you'll need half a yard each of double gauze fabric and an organic bamboo terry fabric. Prewash and dry both fabrics, then lay the fabrics down with right sides together.  Cut the fabric into 4-inch squares.  You'll need one square of each fabric for each makeup remover pad you want to make: We suggest making one for each day of the week, so you only have to wash them once a week.  Step 2: Sew Fabric Squares Once you've cut the fabric squares, place one gauze square on top of a terry square with right sides together and clip or pin the fabric in place.  Use a ¼-inch seam allowance to sew around all four edges, leaving a one-inch opening on one side.  Clip the corners and turn the pad right side out.  Repeat this step for each pad you want to make.  Step 3: Finish Sewing Pads Once you've sewn and turned each pad right side out, fold in the edges of the one-inch opening and iron to flatten the seams.  Then topstitch with a 1/8-inch seam allowance around all four edges of the pad, which will close the gap you left earlier.	84.86950066802092

While the color remover works well, it doesn’t smell very good, and it does significantly dry out the hair.  • The second option is nearly as effective as using a color remover, but it is much gentler on the hair and it doesn’t involve any bleach.  The added bonus is that it’s a fun DIY recipe!  All it’ll require is your clarifying shampoo of choice and some vitamin C powder.  You can either buy vitamin C powder as is, or buy vitamin C pills that can be crushed into a powder.  In a bowl, mix together a spoonful of vitamin C powder with an equal amount of clarifying shampoo – you want to make enough so that you can cover all of your hair, so make more if your hair is long.  Apply this mixture to your hair while it is damp, making sure to thoroughly cover every strand.  Once your whole head is covered, put on a shower cap, and let it sit on your head for an hour.

MARCO_42_324634806-29	Among the things you should consider are budget, performance, camera quality, battery life, and, of course, the purpose of getting a phone. Purpose What is the purpose of the phone you’ll be purchasing?  Is it going to be your primary phone that needs to handle intensive applications or will it just be another spare phone for your messaging needs?  Thinking about this will make it easier for you to decide whether you’ll be going for their higher-end products or just the normal keypad phones they offer.  Budget How much are you willing to spend on the device?  If you have a very strict budget, it’s good to familiarize yourself with features that come with the price tag of every phone.  Consider which features are highly useful for you at the price you’re willing to shell out.  This will make it easier for you to filter which products are worth buying.  Performance One of the most important things to consider when buying a phone is its performance.  What phone speed is acceptable for you and your needs?  It’s very stressful to buy a phone that doesn’t provide optimum performance you’re expecting.  Of course, the higher the processor and RAM of the device, the better and faster the performance is.	92.20390024757944

Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.

You can continue to browse that webpage on ANY other Apple device that you own.  This is just an example.  I know there are phones that have this feature but it's the execution part that Apple has done perfectly.  If you don't own any other Apple device, well, backups and all are still very seamless.  3.

Frost Android is a platform that uses the open source operating system, Linux.  It was first introduced as a smartphone platform in 2008 but has since been integrated into computers, tablets and a wealth of mobile devices.  It would be impractical to list every Android phone in existence, not only due to the huge array of varieties but also because virtually any phone can be an Android phone.  The nature of an open source platform is the ability to customize.  There are, however, a few phones that are more popular than others.

I only saw a cluttered screen with every possible color in the world jammed in the home screen.  I used briefly a couple android tablets.  Felt like junk.  IPhone I used superficially.  Interface was better than android.  This article’s first reason is choices, choices and choices.  And that reason itself killed android from my list.  Who said too many choices is a good thing.  Every choice is a set of varied parameters that needs to be weighed in before making a decision.  A single choice that has been used, tested and established by a large number of user base over years seems like a better deal to me.  IPhone did that.  People don’t grow fans out of thin air.  There has to be stuff backing it.  Hardware is always ahead of software in recent years.  Meaning software doesn’t utilize full potential of hardware in most cases and hardware remains unutilized.  So powerful hardware isn’t a lucrative thing in phones.  Software that works consistently, gets updated frequently and has clean user interface is all that matters.

Here is a post by Azzief Khaliq that argues for and against the effects of Android OS fragmentation you should check out.  Here, the Windows Phone’s fast and user-friendly OS plus its integration with Microsoft-linked products has given many users, particularly who work a lot with Windows products, a reason to consider the integrated mobile platform.

But Microsoft isn't done with mobile.  What makes a mobile platform successful?  Nadella was probably right in his early assessment that there was no room for a third mobile platform in the traditional slate smartphone sense.  Nadella made later statements about bringing an ""ultimate mobile device to market,"" that is ""beyond the curve.""  This lends credence to the belief that his reservations about a third mobile platform were limited to refraining from competing in a market with entrenched rivals, invested users, an app store and developer economy that had passed slow-moving Microsoft by.  The current 11-year-old mobile infrastructure revolves around app ecosystems, strong developer and carrier relationships, OEM partnerships in the case of Google and Android, and premium hardware and software synergy for Apple.  From 2010 to 2015 Microsoft tried (perhaps half-heartedly) to adapt its mobile efforts to this infrastructure but failed miserably.

Running is also vital to the frame of mind he requires for his creativity: ""I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.  I find spending an hour or two every day running alone, not speaking to anyone, as well as four or five hours alone at my desk, to be neither difficult nor boring...the hour or so I spend running, maintaining my own silent, private time, is important to help me keep my mental well-being.

Whether its first thing in the morning (my preference), or after work (great for stress relief), sticking to a routine makes it easier to follow through with your activity every day.  The last thing you want is to run out of time and willpower on a given day, and end up skipping a day.  Knowing exactly what you want will help you get it.  4.  Keep a Daily Log Whether it’s a calendar or large notebook, take the time to jot down how far you ran each day and how your run went.  Write what you want to improve tomorrow.

A phone is one accessory that most of us want to take with us on the run.  Whether you want to: listen to music or podcasts, use a fitness tracking app, snap pictures, make a call, or be ready for an emergency, there are plenty of purposes to carry your smartphone.  You can go out for a run without your phone.  However, there are excellent reasons to have a phone with you while you run: Safety: It’s a good idea to have a phone in your hands in case something goes wrong.  Fitness apps: Strava, Runkeeper, MapMyRun, Nike+, and others can keep that data you want from your workouts – and even help you find your way should you get lost.  Music and podcasts: For those who like music on the roads or trails, your smartphone comes in handy.

All You Need To Know April 26, 2017          / Running Health Q&A / By Jessica Natalie Maybe you are that runner who enjoys listening to music or tracking your mileage whenever you are out on a run.  That said, when it comes to doing both things, your smartphone might be your best bet.  Especially in this day and age, technology is not only so readily available at our disposal, but also a great way to do just about anything, from running to working to entertainment and everything in between.  That said, you would like to carry your phone while you run, as means of tracking your progress and listening to music, but you are concerned about just how to carry it around with you.  Especially since you will be running and bouncing up and down on the road, you do not want your phone to bounce up and down with you, either.  Not only that, but also you do not want for it to accidentally slip out of your pocket or, even worse, get slippery and dirty from the sweat on your hands if you choose to hold it.	85.01005322815035

There are lots of gear and apparel available that address the need to carry a phone while running.  As with most running gear, many products can help you.  It’s a matter of preference which suits your workout habits.  Some runners like to carry their phones in a running belt, while others prefer to keep them in their shorts, in an arm carrier, or a water bottle pouch.  To keep your hands free while enjoying the benefits of a phone, you need to have the right phone holder.  Hence, if you intend to bring your phone during your run, there are many things you need to take into consideration before making a purchase.

For this reason, we’ve broken down our list into five cell phone categories and selected one best cell phone for each.  But before we get there, we should start with some helpful tips on how to choose a new cell phone.  How to Choose the Best Cell Phone When choosing a new cell phone, you should pick one that best fits your needs.  While this may sound obvious to you, many people become the victims of marketing hype and purchase expensive cell phones that, although excellent in many ways, would better server someone with different needs.  Step 1: Pick an Operating System While there are quite a few mobile operating systems, the choice essentially boils down to Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS.  Android advantages Android runs on a large number of smartphones from many different manufacturers.  Android smartphones start at just a few dozen dollars and go up to around thousand dollars for flagship devices.  With Android, you can download over 2 million apps from Google Play Store and easily connect to your Google account to keep your data synchronized across devices.	79.65376076532993

This wittingly happened to be the first gun invented in the history of inventions.  The Song Dynasty which was a ruling dynasty in China, were the ones who possessed these primitive weapons.

MARCO_49_768409405-9	Fortunately, nearly all of the apps can be uninstalled, but it's frustrating to see such a heavy load of bloatware. Conclusions The Samsung Galaxy A10e is an attractive phone, but it fails to nail the basics.  For the same price, you can pick up the Moto G7 Power, a phone that outshines the A10e in just about every way, from performance to battery life.  And if you’re willing to spend a bit more, the new Moto G Power ($250) is an additional step up, and the best budget-friendly phone you can buy right now.

103	134_1-7	How much cheaper is the Samsung Galaxy A10e than the Motorola Moto G7 Power?	MARCO_22_1749042451-6	Motorola Moto G7 Power If you want something more affordable, cheaper, but has the latest in Android and that comes with 5000mAh of battery, then the Motorola Moto G7 Power is an excellent phone to consider. With an ANSI rating of M4/T3, not only that you’ll get the latest in Android, but you’ll also get a phone that has better HAC ratings than Google’s flagship phone and all of that for less than USD$300 SRP.  So if you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t break the bank, something of the latest but not necessarily the best, then we highly recommend considering the Moto G7 Power.  5.  Samsung Galaxy A10e If you want an Android smartphone that’s cheaper, more affordable, and you still find the Moto G7 Power a bit off your budget, then we highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy A10e.  This phone has an ANSI rating of M3/T3 with an SRP of USD $179.99.  In some countries, it is being sold for under 100 which is by far the cheapest Samsung phone with the latest Android OS to date.  So if you’re someone who’s new to the smartphone, or planning to gift this device to your parents or elderly relatives, then the Galaxy A10e is a great option to consider.	94.51299263750116
104	134_1-7	How much cheaper is the Samsung Galaxy A10e than the Motorola Moto G7 Power?	MARCO_33_97721069-6	Poor camera performance is to be expected with phones in this price range, but last year's Moto G7 phones could usually provide sharper photos in our testing. Should you buy it?  Samsung Galaxy A10e 7.5 / 10 Maybe.  I definitely enjoyed using the Galaxy A10e, thanks to its smaller physical size, great battery life, and lightweight design.  The software experience is very close to what you'd get on Samsung's $1,000+ flagship smartphones, and performance was acceptable.  It also works on all major US carriers, which is missing from Nokia's budget phones.  However, the lack of NFC support and a fingerprint sensor might be deal-breakers for some people.  As previously mentioned, Motorola is now selling phones for less money than the Galaxy A10e that have fingerprint sensors and full support for all US carriers — though you still won't get NFC for contactless payments.  The Galaxy A10e also has an extremely poor camera, but you won't get anything significantly better from the competition at this price range.  Buy it if: You want a Galaxy phone, but your budget is around $200.  Your priorities are hardware/software performance and battery life.  Don't buy it if: You take a lot of photos.  You need NFC support or a fingerprint scanner.	94.39524801574636

News Technology Phones Samsung Galaxy A10 vs S10 5G: two smartphones £1,000 apart What do you really get when you spend big on a smartphone?  We compare Samsung's cheapest and most expensive new models to find out By Louise Muyanja 20 Sep 2019 Share this page Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email One of the smartphones in the image above costs almost £1,000 more than the other.  On one side, the new A10 has had a facelift, with a sleeker design and larger display.  It costs just £140, which stands in stark contrast to the S10 5G’s eye-watering £1,099 price.  Previously, avoiding the lower end of the price spectrum could be excused if you weren’t a fan of chunky-looking smartphones with small screens and thick bezels.  But cheap phones no longer bear the look of ‘you get what you pay for’.  So what’s happening on the insides that can truly justify the extra cost?  I f you’re wondering whether it’s worth forking out or saving the money, we drill down into the key differences between the top-of-the-range Samsung Galaxy S10 5G and the bargain-basement Samsung Galaxy A10.	86.40925109389354
108	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_76429195-3	The Moto G7 has a sleek glass design, giving it a nice premium feel despite the affordable sticker price. A 6.2-inch Full HD+ display ensures all of your apps, games, and more look sharp and colorful, and the dual 12MP + 5MP rear camera combo takes pretty good photos all things considered.  You get a great software experience on the G7, which is now running Android 10.  Motorola's software goodies are here, too, including Moto Display and Moto Actions (allowing you to chop the phone to enable its camera and twist it to launch the camera app).  And, just like the OnePlus 8, the Moto G7 has hands-free Alexa support and works on all four major U.S. carriers.  We aren't so keen on the lack of NFC with the Moto G7, but as far as mid-range Android phones go, it's one of the best ones out there.  Pros: Build quality is great Large and colorful display Cameras are pretty decent Works with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Alexa access is hands-free Cons: Doesn't have NFC Best Alternative Moto G7 Don't like the OnePlus 8?	79.0991842141375
109	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_33_78846660-10	The Moto G7 is equipped with 64GB of internal storage (expandable up to 512GB), has a relatively snappy Snapdragon 632 processor, and a modest 3,000 mAh battery that should get you through a full day of normal use. Just like the G7 Power, the G7 also has the excellent Moto Display for quickly seeing notifications without turning on the entire screen, as well as Moto Actions for doing things like chopping the phone to turn on the flashlight or twisting it for opening the camera.  Software updates are also a concern here just like they are with the G7 Power, but we'd expect to see an Android 10 update here before it arrives on the Power sibling.  Pros: Glass design is really sleek Large, sharp display Dual rear cameras Storage is expandable up to 512GB Moto Display and Moto Actions are excellent Cons: Motorola's track record for software updates Performance is fine Best Mid-Ranger Moto G7 The best mid-range phone for TracFone.  The Moto G7 is an incredibly solid mid-range phone.  Its display, cameras, performance, and more are all pretty good for the money.	78.11014332342893
110	134_1-11	Interesting. What makes the Motorola G7 such a good award-winning phone?	MARCO_58_970080198-4	On the inside, every version of the Moto G7 has a moderate Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor and runs on a straight-laced version of Android 9 Pie operating system, the latest and greatest from Google. There are some differences beyond that, so I’ll lay them out here.  Motorola Moto G7 ($300): It has the best screen of the bunch (described above), comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM, 64 GB of storage for apps and photos, and a dual 12- and 5-megapixel camera setup on the back.  It has a 3,000-mAh battery that typically had 20–30 percent left in the tank at the end of a day.  Performance-wise, it's a cut above the other G7s.  Moto G7 Power ($250): It has 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, a 6.2-inch 720p display with a larger notch.  The screen looks a little pixely in games and when taking photos, and it has a single 12-megapixel camera on the back.  Its claim to fame is a ginormous 5,000-mAh battery that makes the phone a millimeter fatter (honestly, not that bad) and gives it enough battery that I usually end the day with 65+ percent left.  This battery can last for days.	69.91089253034443
111	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-4	Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone. Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7.  For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.  The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.	94.62653581008249
112	134_1-13	Why is the Samsung Galaxy A50 better than the Moto G7?	MARCO_36_945711051-5	In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen. Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.	92.41269420413494

In low light, the A50 brightens and punches up colors, while photos taken with the G7 are muddier with much hazier and washed out colors.  The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7.  I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.  The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame.  This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

Last updated on March 31, 2019 Last Updated on May 2, 2019 by Husain Parvez The two most popular smartphones are the iPhone and Android phones.  They are developed by different companies and also have unique features.  Smartphone buyers are often torn between these types.  The choice of which one to pick depends largely on the specifications and capabilities which you are searching for.  While there were a number of other smartphone alternatives such as Windows Phone and Blackberry, they have since gone obsolete.  Therefore, majority of smartphones today are either iPhones or Android phones.  IPhone vs. Android: What Should You Get?  Here are some characteristics that can guide your choice as you pick the right one.  Apple vs Android – Easy To Use If you’re searching for a smartphone that is easy to use, the iPhone is a better pick.  This smartphone has a simple interface that is easy to learn, use and maintain.  It provides you with a home-screen which contains a collection of icons.  You can also personalize it with a photo.  Thus, it is uncluttered and easy to utilize.  iPhone or Android – Maximum Control Sometimes you may want to have extra control over your smartphone.	81.59242326486856

And plenty of people prefer this.  Which Android Phone Should You Get?  Samsung Phones – Great For Design & Specs OnePlus Phones – Brilliant Design, Amazing Software Google Pixel Phones – Best For Camera & Software Updates OPPO Phones – Great For Specs, Hardware & Fast-Charging Capabilities What About A Phone’s Specs?  Should You Care?  CPU When it comes to CPUs, the Android market is dominated by one brand – Qualcomm.  The vast majority of Android phones you can buy today use one of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors; either its high-end, performance chips like the Snapdragon 865 or its cheaper mid-range SoCs like the SD 765G or 690 which you’ll find in sub-£300 phones.  Apple’s iPhones ( and iPads) run on the company’s insanely powerful A-Series SoCs – the A13 is currently the most powerful mobile CPU on the market right now and you’ll find it inside the iPhone 11 range and the cheaper iPhone SE 2020.  This is what makes the iPhone SE 2020 so darn appealing; it’s a £419 smartphone with a flagship-grade CPU inside it.  Does your phone’s CPU matter?	80.00006039300933

NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- iPhone users almost have it easy when choosing a new phone, currently the best options are the big iPhone 6, or the bigger iPhone 6 Plus.  Choosing an Android phone can be a bit harder since there are so many options available.  With that wide selection comes more competition, though, and there's an argument to be made that some of the phones are even better than the iPhone, no matter which iPhone you're talking about.  What makes an Android phone better than an iPhone is all based on what you value in a phone.  Maybe you want a more durable, waterproof phone, or a phone with a different design and more color options.  Maybe you really, really want a stylus and a huge display.  Or it could be as simple as you prefer to be locked into Google's ecosystem instead of Apple's because hey, no one company's products are right for everyone.	77.96297902055085
117	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_56_1657047618-2	If you've taken a break from running because of an injury, note that you should be pain-free before returning to activity. Start slowly and incorporate strength training into your regimen—research shows that resistance training for runners can help aid in recovery and prevent further injury.  1 Depending on the severity of your injury, it may be a good idea to get clearance from your doctor or physical therapist before you start running again.  They should be able to provide you with personalized advice on how much and how often to run.  Verywell 1 Build a Habit After a long break, it can be tough to get back into the groove of running on a regular basis.  And if you are a typical runner, you set high standards for yourself for both pace and distance.  As you get back into running, it's important to focus on consistency first.  Don't worry about how fast or how far you run, simply set small goals to run regularly.  For example, on your first week or two back you might set a goal to complete two 3-mile runs at an easy pace.  These workouts will give you a sense of how your body feels as you return to your sport.  You could also start out with brisk walking or with short run/walk intervals.	93.42064175954374
118	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_58_1113525875-4	Walk The fastest way to get back into running is to slow it down. Even if that means taking regular walk breaks or signing up for a couch-to-5K walk/run training program, says Hamilton.  In fact, she tells all of her clients who have taken several months off of running to spend the first couple of weeks focusing on walking, not running.  (Try pairing your strength workouts with walking a few miles several times a week to get some miles under your feet.)  Because here’s the cold, hard truth: “If you don't have a long history of running behind you, you may need to start over at the beginning with your training,” she says.  This content is imported from Giphy.  You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.  But don’t freak out.  You'll get back into the swing of things faster than you did the first time around, says Metzl.  Thank you, muscle memory!  Just be patient and listen to your body to know when it’s OK to ramp up your speed and/or mileage.	89.35494039295827
119	135_1-1	How do I get back into running after a year-long break due to work commitments?	MARCO_51_964601708-3	Here's what to do during your break. Make it last.  Take at least one three- or four-week break each year.  Three to four weeks is an optimal layoff duration because research shows that it takes that long for muscles to truly rehabilitate themselves after hard training.  Time it right.  The best time to take a three-week break is at the end of your racing season, after a marathon or whenever your enthusiasm for running wanes.  Stay in shape.  During your break, run just once a week if you ordinarily train three or four times, or twice a week if you usually work out five to seven times.  For each session, complete mile repeats at your 5-K pace (the speed at which you would have run the 5-K before your break started).  Divide your customary weekly mileage by 10 to determine how many reps to do.  For example, if you ran 30 miles per week before your break, do three 1-mile repeats per workout.  The mile repeats will almost completely prevent losses in running capacity.  In other words, you'll get a break without losing fitness.  You can also do no running at all during your break, but it will take you a little longer to get back in shape.	88.7549258299041
120	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_51_964931591-3	Try mixing these exercises into your pre-running routine or adding resistance the functional exercises such as squats and walking lunges on strength-training days. How to use this list: These functional exercises are demonstrated by Jess Movold, NASM-certified trainer and Runner’s World+ Run Coach.  Prior to a run, spend about 30 to 60 seconds performing each dynamic stretch (quad stretches, hip openers and hamstring scoops).  On strength training days, perform each exercise with body weight only for 30 seconds, or load the exercises such as the squats and lunges with enough resistance that you can only perform 10 reps before needing a rest break.  Perform 2 to 3 sets of 10 at this resistance level to improve strength and prevent running related injuries.  [ Runner’s World 10-Minute Cross-Training, gives you five muscle-building routines that take just 10 minutes to get you stronger.]  Dynamic Stretches: Dynamic stretches are functional exercises because they are typically performed in positions and movement patterns similar to those needed to perform a daily task specific to runners.  According to research identified by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA), dynamic stretching has been shown to improve running performance.	81.23615131992847
121	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_30_242013167-13	Here’s a drill you can mix into your training: 1) Perform 5-10 box jumps. 2) Now, run 200-400 meters.  It can be down the block, once around a track, or something similar.  3) Do another 5-10 box jumps.  4) Run 200-400 meters again.  5) Repeat for 3-5 rounds total.  This drill is awesome for increasing that hip strength and directly applying it to your running.  Try throwing it into your training program once a week! 11.  Run Faster To Get Faster The last of our running exercises to get faster!  Fartlek means “speed play” in Swedish, where the concept was born.  By using different types of speed work and interval training on your runs you’ll practice finding different “running gears.”  By avoiding always running at the same pace, especially on those longer distances, you’ll get better at pushing through performance plateaus.  The Fartlek technique for runners is nothing short of EFFECTIVE.  Try this out on your next run: You will pick sections of your run to “push it” on.  You make the rules.  Pick something that you’ll encounter a number of times over your course: stairs, a telephone pole, a hill.	75.53922862745821
122	135_1-3	Cool. What exercises can I mix with running?	MARCO_11_220451181-5	For balance, mix HIIT training with short runs, and you can benefit from both. HIIT workouts for runners At-home HIIT for runners To supplement your outdoor or treadmill running, spend some time doing core, leg and hip strengthening HIIT workouts.  This one combines two movements, mountain climbers and squats.  This particular HIIT method we’ll use here is called Tabata.  Tabata is eight rounds of 20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest.  Start with a mountain climber Tabata.  Here’s how: 20 seconds of mountain climbers 10 seconds of rest Repeat 8 times After eight rounds of mountain climber, rest for one minute.  The second Tabata features squats: 20 seconds of squats 10 seconds of rest Repeat 8 times HIIT running session HIIT workouts aren’t reserved for the indoors or strength exercises.  If you want to improve your speed and power, you can also do a HIIT running workout in the form of sprints.  Another fun option is doing intervals of strength exercises and jogging during your rest periods.  Here are two examples of HIIT running routines: Sprint for a certain amount of time (20-30 seconds) or a certain distance around (the 1/8-mile or 200-meter straight-away), then walk for 10-20 seconds to recover.  Repeat 8+ times.	73.94694650918245

126	135_1-7	Awesome. Can I do these strength routines and run on the same day?	MARCO_24_1875686464-38	If   performing   several   activities   in   one   session,   perform   your   weak- est   activity   first   while   you   are   still   fresh.   Avoid   over-exercising   a   body   part   with   too   many   exercises   or   activities   in   the   same   day.    Note   that   the   schedule   does   not   place   upper   body   strength   training   and   swimming   or   lower   body   strength   training   and   running   on   the   same   days.    Since   there   is   some   overlap   between   the   demands   of   weight   lifting,   calisthenics   and   core   exercises,   do   not   combine   more   than   two   of   these   routines   on   a   given   day.    You can   do   some   calisthenics   and   core   training   on   the   same   day   as   strength   training,   but   don’t   exhaust   your- self   with   all   routines   on   the   same   day.	87.26111553458759
127	135_1-7	Awesome. Can I do these strength routines and run on the same day?	MARCO_56_1668736058-8	Strength Training and Cardio If you like doing strength training and cardio on the same day, but you hate how long it takes to do both, you may want to split your workout into two separate routines. Start your morning with whichever workout is most taxing (for instance, if you tend to lift heavy, do your strength training in the morning, but if you're training for a race, run or bike first thing), then do the opposite routine in the evenings.  Split Sessions When you're training for a serious competition or event, splitting your training into two separate sessions is a good way to add miles or repetitions while giving your body rest between workouts.  For instance, if you're training for a marathon, you could split your miles into two running sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening.  Likewise, if you're a strength athlete, you could lift certain muscle groups in the morning, and different ones in the evening.  A Word From Verywell If you decide to give two-a-days a go, ease your way into it.  As Mentore suggests, don't start with more than two days of twice-daily routines in a row, and decrease your overall intensity for a few weeks before ramping up your effort.	84.05774000738165

MARCO_20_27502589-8	Not only will that bore you quickly, but it can promote a plateau – which you certainly don’t want when your goal is to get results fast. Doing cardio and strength training workouts on the same day isn’t necessary, and neither is a gym membership.  Get your cardio on by going for a run in the neighborhood.  For an extra challenge, find some hills to incorporate into your route.  Running on an incline will get your heart rate up higher, and challenge you more.  If you don’t want to purchase free weights, you can use your own bodyweight for strength training.  Planks and sit-ups are great for working your core muscles, while squats and lunges work your glutes and legs.  Be choosy about what you do for exercise — opt for activities that don’t take a lot of time but give you a great calorie burn.  High-intensity interval training, HIIT, is one of the most effective ways to burn calories and torch fat, especially that pesky belly fat.  As far as strength training goes, lift your weights in a circuit training fashion with exercises performed back to back with little to no rest between.	83.26266331973602

It is the best fat-burning substitution for grapefruit.  But, don’t include oranges as they give the opposite results.  6.Is there any better alternatives for Banana in the Military Diet?  Banana has been recommended on almost all three days of the military diet.  But, if you don’t like it, then you can substitute 1 whole banana with either a cup of Papaya or 2 kiwis or 2 apricots.  So, that makes ½ banana replaceable with ½ cup of papaya, 1 kiwi or 1 apricot.  7.Broccoli Alternatives on the 3 day diet The best substitute for broccoli are green vegetables such as: – Spinach – Asparagus – Brussel sprouts – Cauliflower 8.Substitute for Saltine Crackers in 3 Day Military Diet Each saltine cracker gives you around 13 calories.

131	135_3-1	Okay. Are there better calorie-burning exercises to try asides from running?	MARCO_01_1154692318-3	Bike Longer Polka Dot Images/Polka Dot/Getty Images Another factor that makes cycling a better calorie-burning activity than running or swimming is that you can do it for longer. Since cycling doesn't have the high impact of running and has built-in rests, reasonably fit cyclists can ride for a long time, burning more total calories.  For example, our 130-pound woman would burn about 2,600 calories running a four-hour marathon.  Conversely, if she biked a six-hour century (100 miles), she would burn 4,250 calories--an extra 1,650 calories--for a similar effort.  Tips to Burn More Calories Polka Dot Images/Polka Dot/Getty Images The best thing you can do to burn more calories over time is to ride often.  You burn calories faster if you ride hard.  You can't ride hard every day, but schedule a few rides a week where you pick up the pace by pushing a harder gear, spinning at a higher cadence or riding uphill until you're sucking wind.  These kinds of workouts also take more energy (calories) for recovery.	82.11198947398225

However, you’ll see skiers enjoying the well-known powdered back bowls for experts.  If you’re looking for something besides just skiing, kids will enjoy the popular Adventure Ridge at the top of Vail Mountain.  And to get there, you won’t have to trek; just take a calm, rolling Gondola to the top.  Once there, kids can go tubing, snow-biking, snow-shoeing, and even enjoy a spin on a micro-snowmobile.  How cool!  In the end, Vail has a lot of great terrain and many good programs that accommodate families well.  However, I feel that it’s very overpriced, and you can get a much better value by skiing somewhere else.  Colorado is famed for its world-class skiing for a reason.  Turning out Olympian skier after Olympian skier, alongside champions in all other winter sports – it’s the epicenter of all things snow in the US.

MARCO_18_2943050931-5	Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice-skating, indoor or outdoor swimming, and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. Après-ski ( French: after skiing) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts.  These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding.  The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear.  Though the word ‘ski’ is a derivation of the Old Norse ‘skíð’ via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.  Environmental impacts See also: Environmental impact of tourism and Vegetation and slope stability The process of resort development have progressed since the birth of the skiing industry.

Grass Skiing Grass skiing can be done on most slopes – the essential thing (besides knowing what you’re doing and having the slope owner’s permission) is the grass ski – a kind of skate with mini tank-tracks on its base with which you ‘ski’ over dry grass, down a slope.

Always warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before starting any exercise.  Jump rope Equipment: gym shoes (sneakers), jump rope Benefits: Jumping rope helps develop better body awareness, hand-foot coordination, and agility.  Safety: Your jump rope should be adjusted for your height.  Stand with both feet on the middle of the rope and extend the handles to your armpits.  That’s the height you’re going for.  If it’s too long, cut or tie it to avoid tripping on the rope.  Duration and frequency: 15 to 25 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week Following a jump rope circuit is a great indoor or outdoor activity, though you’ll want to make sure you have plenty of space.  Your circuit routine should take 15 to 25 minutes to complete.  If you’re a beginner: Start by jogging forward as you swing the jump rope over your head and under your feet.  Do this move for 15 seconds.  Next, reverse your direction and jog backward as you continue to swing the jump rope.  Do this move for 15 seconds.

The following 11 tips will help get you back on track towards achieving your weight objectives: Increase your fiber intake Fiber-rich foods are excellent at making you feel full even when you are not.  This is critical for losing weight.  Fiber can be sourced from foods like oats, brown rice, fruits and vegetables, and lentils.  In addition, fiber is ideal for individuals looking for what to eat to get ripped fast.  Consume smaller portions of food A good trick to prevent you from consuming a lot of food and keep your weight in check is to use smaller plates and bowls when eating.  This can help you a great deal as it simply allows you to take in lesser calories.  Cook your own meals If you are going to lose weight, you have to cook more of your meals.  Although eating at restaurants is timesaving and enjoyable, cooking your meals allows you to pay attention to many things, making it a great way to maintain your weight.

MARCO_42_625253288-2	Table of Contents Weight Loss Tips Weight Loss Exercises Weight Loss Diet Plans Side Effects of Fad Diets Summary Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 10 Weight Loss Tips While losing a significant amount of weight in a week is not practical, we have a few tips to help you get started on your weight loss journey. Simply remember to maintain a healthy, balanced diet, and not any fad diet that you may find.  1.  Eat Healthy and Regularly Consider what you can add to your regular diet rather than what you must not consume when you wish to lose weight.  Ideally, consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains and pulses.  Most dietitians recommend that you do not skip any meals.  Ensure that you control your meal portions and that you receive all the nutrients you need from the food you eat.  If you wish to lose weight in a goal-oriented manner, make sure to cut back on carbohydrates, salt, butter, sugar, and fried foods.  The easiest way to adopt these changes is to prepare your food yourself, and staying mindful of what exactly you are eating.  2. Increase Protein Intake An important component of any weight loss diet is protein.	80.19694650545716

144	135_2-5	What if I run on an empty stomach to lose weight?	MARCO_51_971491333-3	“Running on an empty stomach is the best method to lose weight” Working out on an empty stomach is often touted as the best way to burn fat and lose weight. While it is true that running on an empty stomach, if done in the right way, can eventually force your body to increasingly obtain the energy it needs from free fatty acids, this is not the decisive factor in losing weight.  The percentage of energy produced by burning fat is quite high, but the total energy expenditure (TEE) and thus calorie consumption are relatively low due to the low training intensity.  In the case of a high-intensity running session, like interval training, the percentage of energy produced by burning fat is significantly lower.  However, the TEE and the calorie consumption are many times higher.  At the end of the day, what matters most in weight loss is the energy balance: If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight.  Therefore, high-intensity running sessions are preferable to running on an empty stomach when it comes to losing weight.  3.  “Running on an empty stomach increases your endurance” Workouts on an empty stomach are not a good idea for leisure athletes who want to improve their performance.	92.10882252661249

151	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_09_18864409-2	When we exercise, the opposite occurs; blood flow is redirected from internal organs to the large working muscles to provide the necessary energy for muscle contraction. When we have a large amount of food in our stomach, running is difficult or uncomfortable because our body is simply not designed to do both digestion and exercise at the same time.  Stomach cramps, stomach aches, or gastro-intestinal distress are the most common complaints when trying to run on a full stomach.  The mechanical mixing and jostling that naturally occurs while running can upset the digestive tract too.  Now that said, some athletes are able to eat and run.  Endurance athletes train their bodies to eat on the run.  Even at the marathon distance, runners must ingest some nutrition during the race, although hardly a large meal.  Experimenting in your training with eating and running will let you know just how much you are able to eat before a run.  For the best training results though, allow three to four hours after eating before running, especially if the workout calls for some intensity.  All the best, Susan Paul, MS	88.42598534488934
152	135_2-9	Hmm. Why isn’t running on an empty stomach a good idea for leisure athletes?	MARCO_51_971491333-4	Training duration and intensity are severely restricted by the lack of glycogen. Therefore, the intended training stimulus is rather low.  A high-quality workout lasting longer and at a higher intensity is better for increasing your performance.  Scientific studies on professional athletes have shown that very positive effects can be achieved by specific workouts with previously emptied glycogen stores.  This causes your body to optimize and economize its fat metabolism.  The body learns to make do longer with the glycogen stored in the muscles.  However, there is no substantial evidence showing that this leads to improved race performance.  At the same time, it is important to note that regular training with previously emptied glycogen stores can adversely affect your health.  Even if there are more effective methods of losing weight or improving endurance, running on an empty stomach can add some welcome variety to your training.  This kind of training is particularly suited for morning people who want to get their workout in before breakfast.  So if you want to run on an empty stomach, here is what we recommend: Depending on your fitness level, your run should last between 40 and 60 minutes.  Choose a low intensity (at a recovery run or conversation pace).  You should drink a glass of water before your run.	85.84582992480136

Take a break if you start to feel lightheaded.  The exception is if you’re running a long distance or doing a high-intensity run.  These activities require a lot of energy, so it’s wise to eat before.  Healthy snacks before and after running If you do want to eat before a run, choose a light snack.  Focus on healthy carbs.  Eat your snack 1 to 3 hours before running.  Ideal pre-workout snacks include: whole grain cereal whole wheat toast banana apple yogurt granola bar without added sugars After running, eat lean protein and healthy carbs within 2 hours.  These nutrients will support muscle recovery and replenish your glycogen stores.  Examples of good post-workout meals include: turkey sandwich with whole wheat bread and vegetables oatmeal and peanut butter yogurt and fruit salmon with avocado and quinoa fruit smoothie with Greek yogurt and nut butter Also, drink water before, during, and after your run.

159	136_1-1	What was the basis of the Watergate scandal?	MARCO_03_735734322-10	It also sparked the Wright Patman investigation, which was eventually blocked after White House intervention in October, 1972, but which apparently led Senator Edward M. Kennedy to conduct a quiet, three-month investigation of his own as chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on Administrative Practices and Procedure. On the basis of Kennedy’s findings, the Democratic leadership of the Senate decided to hold hearings on Watergate.  The result was the creation of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, the Ervin Committee, through which the nation learned of the White House tapes the specific cause of the drive to impeach Nixon.  In the most significant ways, the Dahlberg article represents the chief contribution of The Washington Post in the course of the Watergate scandal.  It seems quite possible that had there been no Dahlberg check story, there would have been no Ervin Committee, no revelation of the existence of the tapes, and little pressure exerted to force those who knew of the coverup to come forward.	87.33805613801815

WAPO_0e8036d97af06e5d5786d87a6fd46eaf-3	Hovering over the entire proceeding was the hypothesis that Nixon, and his men, were guilty of criminal conspiracies, with the Watergate break-in itself just one piece of a larger puzzle that involved an enemies list and dirty campaign tricks and slush funds and “black bag jobs” and general thuggishness. Incredibly, the scandal had been secretly taped.  And one of the tapes had a gap!  An 18 and a half minute gap!  Which Nixon blamed on Rose Mary Woods, his secretary.  Riiiiiiiiight.  The astonishing hypothesis of the Watergate scandal was that the Nixon White House had corruption in its DNA -- that the abuse of power was a routine matter for the administration, and that the president’s natural paranoia, his insecurity, his trickiness, had generated a malevolence and criminality that had spread to every root and twig of the organism.  The president had his defenders, of course, including one of my senators from Florida, Ed Gurney, who served on the Ervin committee.  The ranking Republican, Howard Baker, seemed committed to the truth no matter where it led him.  Sam Ervin, the chairman, was a lovable, simple country lawyer, as he put it.  The proceedings were, let it be noted, glacial.  I have no idea if today such hearings would have the same effect.	82.61287791468203

MARCO_01_1448508478-1	Significance Of The Watergate Scandal Significance Of The Watergate Scandal    Significance Of The Watergate Scandal The Watergate Scandal took place when Richard Nixon was the president and it led to the indictment of many advisors of the president.  It was because of the scandal that Nixon was forced to resign on August 9th, 1974.  The significance of the Watergate Scandal was immense.  The scandal broke out because of break in that occurred in the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee on June 17th 1972.  A total of 5 burglars were arrested and further investigation revealed that the burglars and some advisors of the president were involved in conspiracy and illegal wiretapping.  Also, it was found out that the involved men were either directly or indirectly employed by the president's Committee to Reelect the President.  The significance of the Watergate Scandal is as follows: The US Congress decided to curtail the power of the president when it came to deployment of troops, money matters and freedom of information.  With the impeachment proceedings that began against Richard Nixon, it was shown to the Americans and the rest of the world that no person was above the law.  The scandal put an end to Nixon's political career, and left his reputation in tatters.  The Freedom of Information Act was further strengthened and this allowed people to get easier access to government-related documents.	82.63979440461844

If Dean's revelation is correct, it would change the popular understanding of the origin of the Watergate break-in.  That's no small claim.

The money and the men on trial could be linked to the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) at whose head sat the former Attorney General of the United States, and President Nixon’s former law partner, John Mitchell.  At the trial, E. Howard Hunt, who had planned the break-in, and four of the burglars pleaded guilty.  G. Gordon Liddy, who helped in the planning, and James McCord, the other burglar, refused to cooperate, were convicted of various charges, and sentenced to prison.  Shortly after the trial, the United States Senate formed the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, chaired by Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC).  Meanwhile, James McCord, contemplating a long prison term, had a change of heart and wrote a letter to Judge Sirica.  In it, he claimed that high White House officials had pressured the defendants to plead guilty.  The five who pleaded had perjured themselves at the urging of “higher-ups.”	81.45820455485955

The burglars who had not pleaded guilty—Liddy and McCord—went on trial on January 10, 1973, before Judge John Sirica.  The jury found them both guilty.

WAPO_OCLL7TWVP5ALVIKWIOSHRUVCCU-5	Nixon famously asserted executive privilege to block the release of tapes capturing his coverup of the Watergate scandal, defying a congressional subpoena ordering him to turn most of them over. The tapes captured thousands of hours of conversations recorded from the Oval Office, a practice that stopped after Watergate.  At first, he gave Congress 19 tapes — but when they requested 42 others, Nixon instead handed over only transcripts.  In a presidential address to the nation announcing their release, he insisted to the public that the transcripts would exonerate him.  “I want there to be no question remaining about the fact that the president has nothing to hide in this matter,” Nixon said on April 29, 1974.  He explained that he edited the 1,200 pages of transcripts to remove “irrelevant” information that was not subject to Congress’s subpoena, citing executive privilege and privacy concerns and promising that the rest would be sufficient.  But to House leaders, it wasn’t.  Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.) had said that “we will accept nothing less” than the tapes — and months later, they got them.  In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled against Nixon’s claims of executive privilege and ordered the release of the tapes.	80.69046136923134

Nixon had microphones in the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room, his Executive Office Building office and the Aspen Lodge at Camp David, and also recorded phone calls in the Lincoln Sitting Room.  After the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes to Congress in the summer of 1974, prosecutors found they corroborated Dean’s testimony and implicated the president in the cover-up.  “  [  Dean] was first and one of the only, actually, in the higher echelons to give honest testimony,” Robenalt says.  “Other people who testified, including the chief of staff and the attorney general, they all went to jail for lying about what was going on.”  Dean made a deal where he received a reduced sentence for providing key witness testimony and pleading guilty to obstruction of justice.  He served four months in prison and was disbarred from practicing law in D.C. and Virginia.  Still, some of the higher-level Watergate conspirators didn’t actually get a much harsher punishments than Dean.  Former Attorney General John Mitchell and former Chief of Staff H.R.

The release of the tape was ordered by the Supreme Court on July 24, 1974, in a case known as United States v. Nixon.  The court’s decision was unanimous.  President Nixon released the tape on August 5.  It was one of three conversations he had with Haldeman six days after the Watergate break-in.  The tapes prove that he ordered a cover-up of the Watergate burglary.  The Smoking Gun tape reveals that Nixon ordered the FBI to abandon its investigation of the break-in.  After the release of the tape, the eleven Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who voted against impeachment charges said they would change their votes.

One tape, later known as the ""smoking gun"" tape, documented the initial stages of the Watergate coverup.  On it, Nixon and H. R. Haldeman are heard formulating a plan to block investigations by having the CIA falsely claim to the FBI that national security was involved.  This demonstrated both that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and that he had approved plans to thwart the investigation.  In a statement accompanying the release of the tape, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory.  Once the ""smoking gun"" transcript was made public, Nixon's political support practically vanished.  The ten Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee who had voted against impeachment in committee announced that they would now vote for impeachment once the matter reached the House floor.

One way to get understand the impact of Watergate is through examining presidential power.  Ever since World War II and the beginning of a world filled with atomic weapons, presidents have been given more power than ever.  The reason has to do with fear of mass destruction and the need for immediate action in the face of a sudden nuclear threat.  The system of checks and balances that traditionally kept Congress on an even keel with the president started to get bumped out of line.	86.12035204982385

The investigation into the break-in by Nixon campaign workers in June 1972 at the Democratic campaign headquarters at Washington’s Watergate complex led directly to the White House, and by early August 1974, President Nixon faced near-certain impeachment, and a Senate trial, as the allegation unfolded.  Nixon resigned in a nationally televised speech and left Washington on August 9, 1974, as Gerald Ford became president.  Over the years, the scandal has been replayed in various forms.

In this story, the reporters stated that five men had been arrested breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.  The headquarters was located in a Washington, D.C., building complex called Watergate.  These burglars were carrying enough equipment to wiretap telephones and take pictures of papers.  The Washington Post had two reporters who researched deeply into the story.  Their names were Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward; they discovered that one of the suspects had an address book with the name and phone number of a White House official who could have been involved in the crime.

The men had burglary tools, electronic devices, and a gadget that the police thought was a bomb disguised as a smoke detector.  It was a sophisticated electronic-eavesdropping device.  The suspects had crisp hundred-dollar bills and Watergate Hotel keys in their pockets.  Their ringleaders were the gung-ho Gordon Liddy, the former FBI agent counseling CREEP; and E. Howard Hunt, a former CIA ofﬁcer who, the FBI quickly determined, worked for the president of the United States.  Supervisory special agent Daniel Bledsoe was running the major crimes desk at the FBI on the morning of Saturday, June 17, when he picked up the overnight report of the break-in.	73.7076477096416

Glenn/UPI | License Photo June 17 (UPI) -- The 26-month saga that morphed slowly into perhaps the greatest political catastrophe in American history -- and saw the only resignation ever of a United States president -- grew out of a small Washington, D.C., office suite exactly 45 years ago Saturday. Just after midnight on June 17, 1972, five burglars were caught red-handed by plainclothes D.C. policemen in the offices of the Democratic National Committee.  When they were arrested, the middle-aged, suit-clad bandits held sophisticated communications and surveillance electronics, as well as large amounts of cash.  Advertisement The building in northwest Washington that held the DNC's national headquarters was the relatively new Watergate office and hotel complex.  Although virtually no one knew it at the time, the seemingly small-time burglary started a ticking time bomb that ultimately exploded the presidency of Richard M. Nixon .  RELATED UPI Almanac for Saturday, June 17, 2017 The Break-In The five burglars -- James McCord, Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martínez and Frank Sturgis -- forced their way into the Watergate complex and DNC offices around midnight on the 16th to replace failing bugging equipment that had been installed there two weeks earlier.	72.98994858050719

191	137_1-1	"What do you think about Bostrom's ""simulation argument""?"	MARCO_30_1549247804-2	Bostrom’s biggest argument for this belief is called the simulation argument, which he states that, if ancestor simulations are something an advanced civilization would end up creating, then most of the self aware minds that ever come into existence, are simulated ones. Another argument for this belief is the idea of the Boltzmann brain, which argues that in an infinite multiverse, it should be tremendously more common for particles to randomly assemble into a brain that is having the exact same experience as you are having right now, than for particles to create big bangs.Ancestor simulations is a belief proposed by Nick Bostrom, a professor at Oxford University, he believes that, in the future, it will be possible to simulate the actions of all the neurons in the brain and simulate the sensory input to that brain with enough accuracy to convince the simulation that it is a real person.  For it to happen at such a scale as our universe, would seem impossible, but Bostrom made some calculations that show that a super advanced civilization could do this, on such a scale that these virtual minds tremendously outnumber real minds.  There are many articles, videos and interviews on the topic and even people like Neil deGrasse Tyson have backed up this belief.	85.76023664693093

Further, David Benatar, animal rights activist Steven Best, and anarchist Todd May, posit that human extinction would be a positive thing for the other organisms on the planet, and the planet itself, citing for example the omnicidal nature of human civilization.  The environmental view in favor of human extinction is shared by the members of Voluntary Human Extinction Movement who call for refraining from reproduction and allowing the human species to go peacefully extinct, thus stopping further environmental degradation.

Of all the people worried about runaway artificial intelligence, and Killer Robots, and the possibility of a technological doomsday, Bostrom conjures the most extreme scenarios.  In his mind, human extinction could be just the beginning.  Bostrom’s favorite apocalyptic hypothetical involves a machine that has been programmed to make paper clips (although any mundane product will do).  This machine keeps getting smarter and more powerful, but never develops human values.  It achieves “superintelligence.”  It begins to convert all kinds of ordinary materials into paper clips.  Eventually it decides to turn everything on Earth — including the human race (!!!) — into paper clips.  Then it goes interstellar.  “You could have a superintelligence whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible, and you get this bubble of paper clips spreading through the universe,” Bostrom calmly told an audience in Santa Fe, N.M., earlier this year.  He added, maintaining his tone of understatement, “I think that would be a low-value future.”  Bostrom’s underlying concerns about machine intelligence, unintended consequences and potentially malevolent computers have gone mainstream.

MARCO_31_719719292-4	This principle, when applied to the case of simulation, says that the probability that we are living in a simulated world instead of a real one is equal to the fraction of all people that are actually simulated people. By reviewing the probability assignments that Bostrom has just given, it becomes clear that several things have to be the case.  Because the number of simulations run by a civilization capable of running them would be very great, if simulations are done, then the number of people that are simulated would be much greater than the number of people that are not simulated, which would mean that the probability that we are living in a simulated universe is almost unity.  So, it becomes clear that one of two things must be the case.  Either the probability that simulations are run is very small (practically null), or it is almost certain that we ourselves are living in a simulation.  Bostrom asserts that, because we have no reason to believe that either of these possibilities is more likely than the other, we have no reason to change the way we live our lives because of this argument.  However, this isn’t quite accurate.	77.72947061480954

If you’re a fan of science fiction or fantasy then chances are, at some point, you’ve read a book, seen a movie, or watched a series that explored the concept of multiple universes.  The idea being that within this thing we call time and space, there are other dimensions where reality differs from our own, sometimes slightly, sometimes radically.  Interestingly enough, this idea is not restricted to fiction and fantasy.  In science, this is known as the Multiverse Theory, which states that there may be multiple or even an infinite number of universes (including the universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.  In this context, multiple universes are often referred to as parallel universes because they exist alongside our own.  The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James.  However, the scientific basis of it arose from the study of cosmological forces like black holes and problems arising out of the Big Bang theory.	92.08592542546104

By Heather Brown In the world of physics, there are many theories and ideas floating around about the world and the universe we live in.  Among the many theories floating around that usually gets a lot of discussion and attention is the multiverse or the meta-universe theory.  For folks that have an interest in physics and the possibilities of worlds other than the one we have now, this is one theory that bears pondering.  What Is It?  The multiverse theory is what experts call the hypothetical set of finite or infinite possible universes, counting the historical universe that people regularly experience.  These finite or infinite possible universes compromise everything that exists and everything that can come into existence such as: • Space • Energy • Time • Matter It also takes into account the constants and the physical laws that describe those mentioned previously.  These universes contained within the multiverse are what people sometimes call “parallel universes.”  What are These Parallel Universes?

Multiverse Theory The multiverse theory is one of the leading arguments about the origins of the Universe.  According to it, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of whom is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  The grid of Universes is known as a Multiverse, where each bubble, after springing into existence, expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light.  According to the Multiverse Theory, our Universe is one of a series of cluttered cosmic bubbles, each of which is oblivious to their neighbor’s presence.  (Photo Credit: Silver Spoon / Wikimedia Commons)  This whimsical theory is corroborated by the CMBR and the theory of inflation, where the former is an indisputable proof of the Big Bang and the latter is a compelling explanation for the Universe’s homogeneity.  However, conclusive evidence has yet to come to light.  The theory essentially explores what might have existed before the Big Bang, a question that cannot be answered right now, as it requires knowledge of singularities, which we don’t yet fully possess, as mentioned earlier.	83.13713819370605

We’re using a bit of a ’90s heist genre component.  Thanos is on a smash-and-grab, and everybody’s trying to catch up the whole movie.”  So it sounds like Thanos will be spending most of Infinity War hunting (and likely getting) the Infinity Stones, while the Avengers are playing catch-up, trying to stop him.  Paul Bettany ’s Vision no doubt plays a major role in this, as the Mind Stone is embedded in his forehead and is what gives him his power.  We saw in the first trailer that Thanos tries to pry this stone from Vision’s head, so yeah, things don’t look great.  This also kind of explains why this story is divided into two movies.  Infinity War is the arrival of Thanos and his hunt for the Infinity Stones, while the untitled Avengers 4 will likely find Thanos in possession of most if not all of the Stones while the Avengers make one last stand.	90.0733336309204

If you act shy in front of him, then he will have a more difficult time overcoming his own shyness.  Build your child’s self esteem.  Children who feel good about themselves are less likely to be shy.  Identify your child’s strengths and build on them.  Is he creative?  Is she athletic?  Encouraging these skills will allow your child to see himself as a talented and capable individual.  This sense of confidence can help him become braver in social situations.  Use books!  Read books with your child that feature characters who have overcome extreme shyness.  Use the stories as a starting point for discussions about shyness and how it affects her life.

Why even try?”  The motivation to try is lost.  Always be very specific when you are giving negative feedback.  And make sure your criticism is constructive.  Say “Look – this small step in this sum has made the whole answer wrong.  Let me explain the step to you again and then do 10 sums like this.  That will ensure that you will never make this mistake again.”  Do not be grumpy and complaining When teenagers don’t do well in academics – they typically start slipping in other areas of their lives as well.  They start keeping their rooms untidy, they neglect their personal hygiene like taking bath and brushing etc.  They dress untidily in crushed clothes and so on.  This can make you more and more irritated and you may look at your child in disgust whenever she/he is around you and start pointing out everything that is wrong with your child at all times of the day.  Do not do this.  It can be extremely demotivating.  This is the time to support your child and find out why your child is behaving like this with expert help – instead of constantly criticizing her/him.  First help your teen improve in academics.	84.36369530999013

Whether its a lack of personal space, a disregard for other’s feelings, or his inability to be flexible in a situation, my son struggles with everyday life activities that many children don’t have to even think twice about.  In exchange, he often feels isolated, picked on, and singled out.  He struggles with making the connection between socially acceptable behavior and his need for sensory input.  My son is not alone.  In fact, many times children struggle with these same skills and are pinpointed as a bully, the “mean” kid, non-compliant, or defiant.  When the truth is that these children, like my son, are spending so much energy trying to regulate their nervous system, that they do not have anything left for social cues and social “niceties”.  6 Simple Strategies to Teach Social Skills When it Doesn’t Come Easy #1 Educate Yourself The first step in teaching a child who struggles with social skills is to educate yourself on the possible reasons behind their lack of skills.

MARCO_21_649119539-2	Comparing her body to the images she sees in the media can also affect how she sees herself; if she's unable to afford the most popular clothing or is larger or smaller than popular musicians and actors, she may feel inferior to both her peers and celebrities. The beginning of puberty can deliver a blow to a teenager's self-esteem.  As she starts developing crushes on peers, a teenager will become more concerned with her appearance than she was as a child.  Social Experiences The Importance of Belonging in Teenagers Learn More A teenager's home and school life will both affect his self-esteem.  If he's raised in a loving and nurturing home and has a close-knit group of supportive friends at school, his self-esteem may be higher than that of a teen who is being raised by critical parents and has few friends.  Being teased or shunned by classmates or criticized by teachers can also damage a teenager's self-esteem.  If he has a physical or mental disability or belongs to a different race or religion than most of his peers, he may feel embarrassment and shame that can transform into low self-esteem.

219	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_50_2592459030-9	Since Facebook and other sites give kids their own page which is about them, it leads some vulnerable kids to think that everything revolves around them, a precursor for emotional problems in their later life. This might also result in inability to empathize.  These sites make kids prone to sensationalism.  A study by a team of economists at the University of Sheffield, shows that the more time children spend chatting on Facebook, Snapchat, WhatsApp and Instagram, the less happy they feel about their school work, the school they attend, their appearance, their family and their life overall.  Children see their friends portraying themselves in idealized state when they post in social media.  A vulnerable teen may suffer from depression when he reads great things happening to his friends, and his life is not so great in comparison.  This effect was found to be worse for those who lack self-confidence.  However, the study also found that teens in social media feel happier about their friendships.  Pediatricians observe that some teens suffer from “Facebook depression”.  After spending a lot of time on Facebook and other popular social networking sites, some teens become anxious and moody.  Again, this seems to be caused by being exposed to friends whose idealized presentation of their lives appear to be superior to theirs.	87.92726645001676
220	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_32_154714576-3	Furthermore, social media overload may lead to problems with self-esteem, particularly in teenage girls. “Many girls are bombarded with their friends posting the most perfect pictures of themselves, or they’re following celebrities and influencers who do a lot of Photoshopping and have makeup and hair teams,” Dr Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist at the Child Mind Institute, says in an article for Childmind.org “If that’s their model for what is normal, it can be very hard on their self-confidence.”  Another reason why depression is associated with social media might be what psychologists call displacement – which means what teenagers are not doing during time that’s displaced by social media.  This includes mental health-boosting activities such as exercise, sleep and developing talents.  “If you’re spending a lot of time on your phone, you have less time for activities that can build confidence, a sense of achievement and connectedness,” Dr. Hamlet explains.  “Yes, you get a little dopamine burst whenever you get a notification, or a like on a picture, or a follow request.  But those things are addicting without being satisfying.”  Sleep and low self-esteem One crucial thing that social media can displace is sleep.	85.72399603249505
221	138_1-9	Do you think social media might play a role in my son's low self-esteem?	MARCO_56_1626952454-5	Build Self-Worth If your teen only feels good when they get a certain amount of likes on social media or when they fit into a certain size pants, they'll struggle to maintain confidence when situations don't suit their needs. Basing self-worth on superficial things, external circumstances, or other people leads to a lack of confidence in the long run.  Help your teen build a healthy and stable foundation for self-worth.  Emphasize your values and teach that true self-worth is about living according to those values.  Help them see that it’s more important to be kind and caring rather than thin or attractive.  5 ﻿﻿ Balance Freedom with Guidance Micromanaging your teen’s choices will only reinforce that they can’t be trusted to make good decisions independently.  It’s important to balance just the right amount of freedom with plenty of guidance.  Provide your teen with plenty of opportunities to practice the skills you’ve taught.  Let them experience natural consequences and they'll learn from their own mistakes.  Over time, they'll develop increased confidence in their ability to make healthy choices.  Natural Consequences as an Effective Discipline Tool Help Develop Positive Self-Talk Your teen’s inner monologue will play a major role in how they feel about themselves.	83.23418876313372

This can work wonders in boosting their self-esteem.  For the entire day, your teen should only think positively about their achievements and themselves, while other family members should affirm their thoughts.  Gratitude journaling – Maintaining a gratitude journal can be immensely satisfying for your teen and help them feel more positive about life and themselves.  Every day, instruct your teen to record at least two things they were grateful for in their life and tell them to increase the number gradually.  Body language test – This exercise is crucial for your teen to curb their self-criticism and negative energy that can eat away their self-worth.  Tell your teen to observe their body language in a mirror when they are having a negative thought.  Then ask them to replace it with a positive thought and observe their body language again.  Negative self-talk exercise – Negative self-talk is an important reason behind low self-esteem.

So, change the conversation to overcome issues with self-esteem for teens.  Esteem-Building Tips Besides rewriting the inner dialogue, help your teen take these steps to improve self-worth: Celebrate what they do well.  Focus on effort instead of perfection.  Reframe mistakes into learning opportunities.  Pinpoint trigger thoughts that cause low self-esteem.  Get adventurous and try new things.  Own their decisions and opinions.  Give back to others through volunteering.  Make wise decisions.  Support your teen’s growth and development by being generous with praise.  This doesn’t mean telling your son or daughter that they’re smart or good-looking.  It means diving into specific situations where they performed well (e.g. cleaning their room, getting a B+ on their math test.)  Use this descriptive praise to celebrate good choices and hard work.  Decision Making and Self-Esteem Decision making remains crucial to a teen’s success.  Yet, developing decision-making skills is an often overlooked process.  And it requires practice.  So, find decision-making opportunities and guide your teen through them.	72.4209207650274

Other well-known structures employing the use of monoliths include tombs such as the ""Tomb of the False Door"" and the tombs of Kaleb and Gebre Mesqel in Axum.   Most structures, however, like palaces, villas, commoner's houses, and other churches and monasteries, were built of alternating layers of stone and wood.  The protruding wooden support beams in these structures have been named ""monkey heads"" and are a staple of Aksumite architecture and a mark of Aksumite influence in later structures.  Some examples of this style had whitewashed exteriors and/or interiors, such as the medieval 12th-century monastery of Yemrehanna Krestos near Lalibela, built during the Zagwe dynasty in Aksumite style.  Contemporary houses were one-room stone structures, or two-storey square houses, or roundhouses of sandstone with basalt foundations.  Villas were generally two to four storeys tall and built on sprawling rectangular plans (cf.  Dungur ruins).  A good example of still-standing Aksumite architecture is the monastery of Debre Damo from the 6th century.   Section::::Zagwe dynasty."	84.35046388168121

Through Western contact with China from the 17th through 20th centuries, the fame of the Great Wall grew and so did tourism.  It grew at a whopping rate after President Nixon visited the wall in 1972.  Today, a portion of the Great Wall of China, about 80 km from Beijing, is host to about 6 million tourists every year.  Many historians have a view that by building a wall of this length, the manpower that went into it, and the deaths reported or assumed during the construction, it would have caused lesser casualties even if another kingdom would have attacked and gotten into a war with China.  But from accounts of the Chinese, the wall stands as a representation of their unity and pride.  Like it?  Share it!  « Previous Post Next Post »	82.32451877743006

In 1644, as Beijing fell to peasant rebels, a Ming general, Wu Sangui, invited powerful Manchu troops to enter China through the Wall at Shanhai Guan (the pass where the mountains meet the sea).  The Manchus proceeded to conquer China, and in the next 150 years, to double the size of the Qing Empire.  Because of that dramatic expansion of China’s borders, the Great Wall today is entirely within the boundaries of the People’s Republic of China, another indication that it never worked as a military barrier.  It didn’t protect the Chinese from the nomads nor the nomads from other nomads.  Today the Great Wall is nothing more than a tourist attraction, though perhaps the most successful tourist attraction in the world.  In the first week of October in 2014, a holiday week, the restored parts of the wall north of Beijing drew 16 million visitors, according to Chinese press accounts.	81.02839030697942
236	139_2-5	Wow, that’s a lot of deaths. How is the Great Wall of China maintained?	MARCO_58_1517960092-4	Despite its effectiveness, it was sometimes ineffective in keeping enemies out such as in 1644 when the Manchu Qing managed to remove the Ming Dynasty and establish a dynasty of their own. The final construction work done on the wall was back in 1878 in the later phases of the Qing Dynasty, which existed from 1644 to 1911.  The construction and maintenance stopped since the wall was rendered obsolete by more advanced weaponry such as fire and explosives.  The Great Wall of China Today The Great Wall of China.  Image credit: Marc van Vuren/Shutterstock Today, the parts of the wall that are still in good condition were erected or maintained during the Ming Dynasty.  Some sections have been renovated in recent times, while others have been destroyed.  Some of the best and most widely known sections from the Ming Dynasty include Jinshanling, Simatai, Mutianyu, and Badaling.  The Great Wall of China is a popular tourist attraction offering magnificent views, with several sections having been declared 5A-rated tourist attractions, which in the rating categories used by the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism means these sections are among the most important and best-maintained tourist destinations of the country.	80.66308983974159

Shah Jahan presented Maharajah Jai Singh with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.  An area of roughly was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at above riverbank.  In the tomb area, wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb.  Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb.  The scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle.   The Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia.  It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.  It took efforts from 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.  The translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.  The turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia.	77.28976865299046

Awaiting your revert.  Happy holidays!  Sup Reply Roger Wade says: January 2, 2019 at 7:01 pm Sup, Happy New Year to you as well!  My strong suggestion is to spend 3 nights in each city you visit for the most part because if you go faster than that you’ll be spending too much of your time on trains and airports and such.  It also adds quite a bit to the cost of the trip every time you go from one city to another.  So in 15 days I’d recommend choosing 5 cities or no more than 6 cities.  I’m among those who feel that Paris is unmissable and that Italy is also ideal for first visits to Europe because the sights are also so amazing.  The fastest visit to those places is Paris for 3 nights, Venice for 1 night, Florence for 2 nights, and Rome for 3 nights.  Venice is quite small so you can enjoy the highlights in 24 hours or so, and Florence is fairly compact as well.	93.06371902360117

You’ll never be able to see the city in just one visit.  It would take years to see everything, but, you can get a good feel of the city in a few days.  4.  Go city hopping There are so many amazing cities in Europe that we’d need a top 100 to list them all.  Some of my personal favorites and must sees are: London, Edinburgh, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Barcelona, Lisbon, Prague, Tallin, Florence, and Stockholm.

246	139_2-13	Tell me about another natural and architectural wonder outside of Asia	MARCO_29_662582548-2	Talk Travel App has compiled a list of reasons why the Taj Mahal should be a part of everybody’s travel bucket list. 1.  The reason behind the construction of the Taj Mahal It was the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan who commissioned the construction of this exquisite monument as an expression of his love to his dear wife Mumtaz Mahal.  Shah Jahan called her Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the ‘Beloved Ornament of the Palace’ or ‘Chosen One of the Palace’.  Her actual name was Arjumand Banu Begum.  In the year 1631, Mumtaz Mahal, unfortunately, breathed her last while giving birth to their 14th child.  Shah Jahan was so devastated with his loss, that he was inconsolable and was in deep grief at her demise.  Shah Jahan decided to move the remains of his dead wife in 1631.  2  . Construction of the Taj Mahal Masons, stonecutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome-builders and other artisans came from the whole of the empire and also from Central Asia.  The Taj Mahal was built in 22 years approximately.  It used the work of around 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants.  The construction finished in the year 1653 after an expenditure of approximately 32 million rupees.	93.65054880040408

Taj Mahal, Agra, India Most travelers put the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a remarkable monument to love, on their bucket list – with good reason.  The almost translucent, 240-foot-tall mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, is made of intricately carved white marble inlaid with semiprecious stones and gems.  Commissioned in 1632, it represents 22 years of labor by 20,000 workers, yet is just one of many stunning Mughal monuments in Agra.  Meiji Shrine, Tokyo One of Tokyo's most popular attractions with 30 million visitors each year, this Shinto shrine embodies the people’s gratitude to Emperor Meiji and his consort, who modernized Japanese society and government in the early 20th century.

MARCO_40_1229337887-2	However, there are now several different categories of the “Seven Wonders”, and knowing which ones are in each category can be most peoples first stumbling block. I recently wrote an article on the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World and the Seven Modern Wonders.  Of the original Seven Ancient Wonders of the World the only one remaining today is the Great Pyramid in Giza.  All of the others have fallen into total disrepair or been lost to time.  The other Ancient Seven Wonders are the Colossus of Rhodes, Greece, Lighthouse of Alexandria, Egypt, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, modern-day Turkey, Statue of Zeus, Greece, Temple of Artemis, modern-day Turkey and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, modern-day Iraq.  The ancient “Seven Wonders of the World” were categorized by Philo of Byzantium in 250 B.C., and since then, just saying the “Seven Wonders” is now no longer specific enough for an audience to understand the parameters.  So beyond the ancient wonders, there are the modern wonders and even the Natural Wonders.  So the next time someone asks you to name the Seven Wonders of the World, your first question should be to ask which of the wonders.

They are also, however, reminders of the human capacity for disagreement, destruction and, possibly, embellishment.  As soon as ancient writers compiled a list of “seven wonders,” it became fodder for debate over which achievements deserved inclusion.  The original list comes from a work by Philo of Byzantium written in 225 B.C. called On The Seven Wonders.  Ultimately, human hands joined with natural forces to destroy all but one of the wonders.  Furthermore, it is possible that at least one of the wonders might not have existed at all.  Still, all seven continue to inspire and be celebrated as the remarkable products of the creativity and skill of Earth’s early civilizations.	80.0474080016138

There was, first, the romantic idea of honest  expression: that a building should be faithful in revealing its  materials and structure, as Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc  (1814–1879) had argued, without any classical ornament or fake  surface or structure.  There was, second, the idea that a  building's form should reflect its plan, its functional  arrangement of interior spaces, as Henry Latrobe and Horatio Greenough  had proposed.  There was, third, the belief that each building should  express something new and distinctive in the times (G. W. F. Hegel    [  1770–1831], Gottfried Semper  [  1803–1879]) and  specifically the new technical resources, such as steel skeletons and electric light and elevators, which suggested  skyscrapers and new forms of building (John Wellborn Root).

Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong.  Newton wanted a swingy pop song like ""Hello, Dolly!"", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with Kapp Records, so when Newton heard the slow pace of ""What a Wonderful World"", he tried to stop the session.  Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over.  Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure.  The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected.  To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work.   The song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it, but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart.

MARCO_19_685468020-3	"The session was scheduled to follow Armstrong's midnight show, and by 2 am the musicians were settled and tape was rolling. Arranger Artie Butler was there with songwriters Weiss and Thiele, and Armstrong was in the studio singing with the orchestra.  Armstrong had recently signed to ABC Records, and ABC president Larry Newton showed up to photograph Armstrong.  Newton wanted a swingy pop song like "" Hello, Dolly!  "", a big hit for Armstrong when he was with Kapp Records, so when Newton heard the slow pace of ""What a Wonderful World"", he tried to stop the session.  Newton was locked out of the studio for his disruption, but a second problem arose: nearby freight train whistles interrupted the session twice, forcing the recording to start over.  Armstrong shook his head and laughed off the distractions, keeping his composure.  The session ended around 6 am, going longer than expected.  To make sure the orchestra members were paid extra for their overtime, Armstrong accepted only $250 musicians union scale for his work.  The song was not initially a hit in the United States, where it sold fewer than 1,000 copies because Newton did not like or promote it, but was a major success in the United Kingdom, reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart."	91.03122499904477

Tran Director : Barry Levinson Motion Picture Rating : R Running Time: 2 hours, 1 minute The film that helped make comedian and actor Robin Williams a household name, Good Morning, Vietnam very loosely chronicles the real-life exploits of Armed Forces Radio Service DJ Adrian Cronauer during the Vietnam War. Rebellious and irreverent, he defies his superiors by playing popular rock music for the troops while simultaneously befriending some of the Vietnamese people his country is at war against.  Good Morning, Vietnam introduced an entire generation of moviegoers to Williams' manic energy and humor, and it's still an effective showcase of the late star's incredible talent.

While Good Morning Vietnam has anti-war and anti-American undertones, Cronauer was completely supportive of the war effort.  Robin Williams’s comedy is completely different from Adrian Cronauer’s: Cronauer was very reserved in his comedic style and stayed mainly within military guidelines.  However, the restaurant bombing incident did occur to a point: while the bombing did occur, and Adrian did notice and bring it up to his boss, he did not go against orders and report the news.

The sitcom idea was scrapped, and screenwriter Mitch Markowitz reworked the script as a feature film.  Director Barry Levinson kept Williams and Mr. Cronauer apart until the film was completed.  “His theory supposedly was that if we met, Robin would subconsciously start trying to do an imitation of me, which would change the characterization,” Mr. Cronauer told the Roanoke Times.  “When the movie premiered in New York, we met, and we shook hands and Robin said, ‘I’m glad to finally meet you.’  And I said, ‘Well, I’m glad to finally meet me, too.’ ” “Good Morning, Vietnam!”  earned Williams an Oscar nomination as best actor and proved to be his breakout film performance.

Lagos de Moreno is occasionally known as the ""Athens of Jalisco"", owing to the numerous writers and poets who were born there.  Lagos de Moreno was founded as Villa Santa Maria de los Lagos on March 31, 1563, by Don Hernando Martel, an Andalusian conquistador.  The town was the economic and cultural center of a region that eventually attracted many ranchers.  By 1600 there were over 20,000 cattle in the region.  Santa Maria continued growing both physically and culturally, and by the 1800s, the town was elevated to a city and renamed to Lagos de Moreno in honor of Pedro Moreno.  Lagos de Moreno was the site of the signing of several important political documents, the two identically named but unrelated Convenios de Lagos.  The arts flourished in the city during the latter half of the 19th century, but this literary boom decreased somewhat after the Mexican Revolution, especially during the 1940s.  Recently, Lagos de Moreno has become an important cultural and tourist destination thanks to its rich history and architecture, some of which still stands from the 17th century ."	97.3337006900074

Temperatures are generally high and consistent, and seasons are more aptly characterised by the difference in rainfall than a change in the mercury.  For example, in Lagos, average temperatures barely range from 77°F (25°C) to 82°F (28°C).  June is the season with peak rains, while January hardly sees any by comparison.  In the south of the country, a coastal region that includes Lagos and the oil-rich area of Port Harcourt, it’s incredibly humid, but it rarely gets hotter than 90°F (32°C).  This area is defined by two rainy periods, one short period and one long period.  The long rainy season begins in late February or early March and lasts until July.

Origins of Jollof Rice Jollof rice originates from Senegal and the Gambia where the Wolof people of that region invented the dish.  No wonder Jollof sounds similar to Wolof.  The Wolof people were also called the Djolof or Jolof tribe.  It is believed that Jollof was invented by a woman who lived near the Senegal river delta.  It is said that this woman substituted rice for barley during a barley shortage.  Using rice, fish, vegetables and tomatoes she created a tasty dish which was called Jollof.  The Senegalese also have another name for this dish, Thieboudienne.  In Gambia, it is called Benachim (One pot).  The Jollof recipe travelled from Senegal to the Gambia, Mauritania then to other West African countries.  The Ghanians amd Nigerians mastered the recipe, became experts and are struggling for copyrights.

KILT_53802305-1	Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation  The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) is an agency of the Nigerian state, and specifically the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and National Orientation, responsible for the overall development of the country's tourism.   Section::::History.   In 1962, the Nigerian Tourist Association was established, without regulatory authorities.  In 1976, the Supreme Military Council ruling the country issued Decree No. 54 that created the Nigeria Tourism Board, the country’s first tourism regulatory body.    The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation was established in 1992 by Decree No. 81.    The National Council on Commerce and Tourism was also created and entrusted with the coordination of the planning and development of tourism.  The Minister of Commerce and Tourism chaired the council, in which state commissioners for commerce and tourism, representatives of travel agents, hoteliers and catering associations, tour operators, and various airlines were represented.   After the country's transition to civil government, in 1999, the new Constitution limited the regulatory power of the federal government “to tourist traffic alone.”	93.4447694311366

However, the tourist attractions can also be found in the country’s major cities.  As an example, Lagos has large modern-park known as Millennium Park which is an important tourist attraction in the city.

308	140_2-3	How's the tourism sector in Nigeria managed?	MARCO_25_227670877-3	Tourism Tourism is still a sector bringing in some much needed revenue but it hasn’t been a strong point for Nigeria’s economic development. Management and maintenance issues have also plagued some places with historical values and tourism appeal.  Mining Nigeria’s mining sector fell down the global pecking order in 2012 and it hasn’t fully recovered but the private investors interested in exploring the mining sector might just help boost it back provided Reform Policies and Opaque business ethics don’t cripple it off.  Electricity Nigeria’s electricity production hasn’t been much to write home about, since the consumption continues to weigh down production.  Nigeria consumes an estimate of 18 billion Kilowatts and the production is way insufficient to have power supply on a regular.  Services Nigeria ranks 63rd worldwide and fifth in Africa in services output.  Low power generation has crippled the growth of this sector.  Economic growth from services output remains stymied by the high cost of doing business in Nigeria, crime threats and associated need for security counter measures, non-transparent economic decision making, especially in government contracting.  Other sectors have also contributed their tits and bits to economic development in Nigeria but no matter how ridiculously easy it sounds, there needs to be serious policy restructure, transparency in public-private partnership, and a change of mentality and attitude.	88.57510257279864

315	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_1442062-1	Calabar  Calabar (also referred to as Callabar, Calabari, Calbari, Kalabari and Kalabar) is the capital of Cross River State, Nigeria.  It was originally named Akwa Akpa, in Efik language.  The city is adjacent to the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers and creeks of the Cross River (from its inland delta).   Calabar is often described as the tourism capital of Nigeria.  Administratively, the city is divided into Calabar Municipal and Calabar South Local Government Areas.  It has an area of and a population of 371,022 as at 2006 census.   Section::::History.   On 10 September, 1884, Queen Victoria signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar.  This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi.   Today, Calabar is a large metropolis with several towns like Akim, Ikot Ansa, Ikot Ishie, Kasuk, Duke Town, Henshaw Town, Cobham Town, Ikot Omin, Obutong.   Section::::History.:Seaport City.   Since the 16th century, Calabar had been a recognized international seaport, shipping out goods such as palm oil.  During the era of the Atlantic slave trade, it became a major port in the transportation of African slaves and was named Calabar by the Spanish.	91.05393862714118
316	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-4	"With the suppression of the slave trade, palm oil and palm kernels became the main exports.  In 1846 a Christian mission was established by the United Presbyterian Church between Duke Town and Henshaw town, with the support of King Eyo.  The mission was headed by Rev. Hope Masterton Waddell with support from Hugh Goldie, who wrote an account of Calabar in his 1890 book ""Calabar and its Mission"".  That year the chiefs requested British protection for Calabar, but the reply from Lord Palmerston, received in 1848, was that it was not necessary or advisable to grant the request.  The British said they would treat the people of Calabar favorably if they would give up their practice of human sacrifice.  At the time, it was common for wives and slaves of an important man to be sacrificed upon his death.   On the death of King Eyamba in 1847, it was proposed that King Eyo become sole ruler, which the British favored.  However, the Duke Town leaders did not agree, and selected Archibong Duke as the new king.  In 1850, both kings agreed to suppress human sacrifice.   British influence continued to grow, as did acceptance of Christianity.  The chiefs of Akwa Akpa placed themselves under British protection in 1884."	89.67639776167562
317	140_1-11	Where did the name Calabar come about then?	KILT_28678189-1	Akwa Akpa  Akwa Akpa, known to European colonists as Old Calabar or Duke Town, was an Efik city-state that flourished in the 19th century in what is now southern Nigeria.  Although it is now absorbed into Nigeria, traditional rulers of the state are still recognized.  The state occupied what is now the modern city of Calabar.   Section::::Origins and society.   The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger–Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.  One tradition says that Abasi's wife Atai persuaded him to let two of their children, a daughter and son, settle on the earth.  They were not allowed to breed, but disobeyed this injunction and became the ancestors of the Efik people.	85.69275117915822

MARCO_51_664966003-3	"Scammers try to swindle small amounts from huge number of candidates in the name of ""pay to audition"" and ""register to join"" schemes that reap no benefit to the user in the end. Social media platforms are highly exploited by these scammers, in order to create fake ads and opportunities that innocent users fall prey to.  The ads and offers may appear to be so real that the users who are applying for these do not look for legitimacy.

Top 5 Ways to spot a casting call scam: Casting call without audition Address requests No wire transfers No proper information Prepayment Casting call without audition : Most of the scam companies tend to call the candidate without any audition.  This is the most common way to spot a casting call scam.  They insist the candidate to join immediately without audition.  The scammer thinks that this is the easiest way to trap the candidate, but the user should be aware that no company or agency has such an urgent requirement to select the candidate without even auditioning.  Address requests : Any casting company that insists on address request of the candidate is to be put on doubt."	84.80728343455121

She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed – this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

MARCO_02_420075955-1	Ponzi scheme - - Moneyterms: investment, finance and business explained Ponzi scheme A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that appears to be actually paying high returns by paying the supposed returns out of victims' own capital.  Ponzi schemes are named after Carlo Ponzi who ran a huge Ponzi scheme in the US in the 1920s.  A typical Ponzi scheme promises investors a high rate of return in a short time.  The money that is collected from investors is used to pay the return.  This means the scam can run for some time, because investors appear to be making the promised return.  Early participants can profit, as they can with a pyramid scheme.  How a Ponzi scheme works The easiest way to explain this is with an example.  Suppose the scheme promises a return of 10% a month.  The scammer simply takes investors' money and returns a tenth of it at the end of every month.  The fact that investors appear to be getting the returns they were promised will encourage more people to put their money in the scheme, and even encourage the original wave of victims to reinvest.  This growth is what makes Ponzi schemes successful.	88.86159337656863

They also tend to duck and emerge under different names in order to protect themselves.  Keep away from companies that give you Bitcoin addresses for incoming payments rather than the common payment processors such as BitPay or Coinbase.  Bitcoin Mining Scams: These companies will offer to mine outrageous amounts of bitcoin for you.  You’ll have to pay them.  That’s the last you’ll see of your money (with no bitcoins to show for it, either).  Bitcoin Exchange Scams: Bitcoin Exchange Scams offer features that the typical bitcoin wallets don’t offer, such as PayPal/Credit Card processing, or better exchange rates.  Needless to say, these scams leave you in the hang while they siphon your dollars.  Bitcoin Wallet Scams: Bitcoin scam wallets are similar to online wallets – with a difference.

Undoubtedly the most famous recent example involved Bernard Madoff, a New York financier who engineered a Ponzi scheme estimated to be in the neighborhood of $65 billion.  Madoff was eventually caught and sentenced to 150 years in prison, but not before pulling of what is essentially the biggest con game of all time.  Other Articles you Might Like Liked it?

At this point the fraudster simply takes the money and disappears.  Spotting Ponzi schemes Common types of Ponzi scheme operate under a variety of names including “high yield investment program” and “high yield debentures”.  Their common characteristics are very high returns with no clear underlying business to generate them.  More complex forms of Ponzi scheme can be harder to detect.  They may well appear to be legitimate investments.  They may even be part of an investment that includes both legitimate and Ponzi elements.  An example of the latter is an investment or finance company that offers very high returns to depositors, and does lend the money (as a real finance company would) to make returns, but does so knowing that the return on loans will not suffice to cover the interest paid to depositors.  Returns that are too consistent are also a reason for suspicion.  This was a characteristic of the fraudulent fund run by Bernard Madoff.	77.76063137734309
339	141_2-5	How do Ponzi schemes unravel?	MARCO_18_1642035430-6	"Unraveling of a Ponzi scheme Theoretically it is not impossible at least for certain entities operating as Ponzi scheme to ultimately ""succeed"" financially, at least so long as a Ponzi scheme was not what the promoters were initially intending to operate. For example, a failing hedge fund reporting fraudulent returns could conceivably ""make good"" its reported numbers, for example by making a successful high-risk investment.  Moreover if the operators of such a scheme are facing the likelihood of imminent collapse accompanied by criminal charges, they may see little additional ""risk"" to themselves in attempting cover their tracks by engaging in further illegal acts to try and make good the shortfall (for example, by engaging in insider trading ).  Especially with lightly-regulated and monitored investment vehicles like hedge funds, in the absence of a whistleblower and/or accompanying illegal acts any fraudulent content in reports is often difficult to detect unless and until the investment vehicles ultimately collapse.  Typically, however, if a Ponzi scheme is not stopped by authorities it usually falls apart for one or more of the following reasons: The operator vanishes, taking all the remaining investment money."	85.5417797411501

MARCO_18_1642035430-7	"Promoters who intend to abscond often attempt to do so as returns due to be paid are about to exceed new investments, as this is when the investment capital available will be at its maximum. Since the scheme requires a continual stream of investments to fund higher returns, if the number of new investors slows down, the scheme collapses as the operator can no longer pay the promised returns (the higher the returns, the greater the risk of the Ponzi scheme collapsing).  Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.

All other cyber currencies are Ponzi schemes, too, except, arguably, initial coin offerings (ICOs) funding actual business start-ups.  Ponzi schemes promise investors returns above what real investments yield, but the Ponzi scheme operator does little, if any, actual investing.  Instead, cash from new investors is paid to earlier investors to maintain the illusion that the scheme is earning real profits.  All Ponzi schemes eventually collapse, of course, when sufficient amounts can no longer be raised from new investors to pay off earlier investors.  The same will occur with bitcoin and all other cyber currencies, except perhaps the ICOs.  Investors will pull back from buying cyber currencies, causing their prices to begin a sustained decline.	80.10135402297601

MARCO_36_840746247-2	A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud whereby crooks steal money from investors and mask the theft by funneling returns to clients from funds contributed by newer investors. Bernard Madoff ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history, a $65 billion scam encompassing thousands of investors that was uncovered in 2008.  Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison, recently said he was dying from terminal kidney disease and asked a judge to grant him early release.  Ponzi schemes alleged by civil and criminal authorities last year pale in comparison to scams unearthed around the time of the 2008 financial crisis, such as Madoff’s and those of other notorious criminals such as Thomas Petters and Allen Stanford, who ran respective $3.7 billion and $8 billion frauds.  In 2008, for example, authorities found 40 Ponzi schemes with a combined $23 billion of investor funds — roughly seven times the amount of funds from last year, according to Ponzitracker, data of which is compiled by Jordan Maglich, an attorney at Quarles & Brady.  While it’s too soon to tell if last year’s total was an anomaly, some experts fear it could herald a return to more sinister times.	90.77396265114658

MARCO_02_407019929-7	Advertisement Ponzi Schemes vs. Pyramid Schemes ­ ­Many people associate Ponzi schemes with pyramid schemes. While they do share some similarities, they're not exactly the same.  If you think about the organization and methodology behind a Ponzi scheme, it certainly has a triangular structure.  The schemer sits at the top, above continually increasing rungs of investors.  However, there are fundamental differences between how classic pyramid schemes are carried out and how Ponzi schemes are executed.  Advertisement The essential difference between a pyramid scheme and a Ponzi scheme is that a Ponzi schemer will only ask you to invest in something.  You won't be asked to take any more action than handing over money.  He or she will claim to take care of the rest and give you your returns later.  The Ponzi schemer is the mastermind behind the whole system and is always shuffling money from one place to another.  On the other hand, a pyramid schemer will offer you an opportunity to make the money yourself.  It requires more work, though: You have to buy the right to start a franchise and start recruiting more people like yourself.  The recruits will often pay the recruiter a cut of their profits.  You can read How Pyramid Schemes Work to understand more about that process.	72.09668394969776

As with the Ponzi scheme, the price exceeds the intrinsic value of the item, but unlike the Ponzi scheme:  BULLET::::- In most economic bubbles, there is no single person or group misrepresenting the intrinsic value.  A common exception is a pump and dump scheme (typically involving buyers and holders of thinly-traded stocks), which has much more in common with a Ponzi scheme compared to other types of bubbles.   BULLET::::- Ponzi schemes typically result in criminal charges when authorities discover them, but other than pump and dump schemes, economic bubbles do not typically involve unlawful activity, or even bad faith on the part of any participant.  Laws are only broken if someone perpetuates the bubble by knowingly and deliberately misrepresenting facts to inflate the value of an item (as with a pump and dump scheme).

The affinity fraud targets a group, often in combination with a Ponzi scheme, such as a religious organization or friend group, by convincing the group to go along with a scam because their friends are involved.  Other scams include misrepresenting qualifications, such as claiming experience or certifications you don't have or promising unrealistic returns, such as claiming an investment will generate huge numbers.  With a ""churning"" scam, the advisor makes lots of unnecessary trades, which costs the customer in commissions and often results in less-than-stellar investment returns.  Ponzi Scheme According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.  Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to generate high returns with little or no risk.”  The Ponzi scheme is a classic scam and incorporates components of other scams as well.

350	141_2-11	What other similar schemes to Ponzi are there?	KILT_47185-1	"Ponzi scheme  A Ponzi scheme (, ; also a Ponzi game) is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.  The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from product sales or other means, and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.   The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi, who became notorious for using the technique in the 1920s.   The idea had already been carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the ""Ladies' Deposit"".  Howe offered a solely female clientele an eight-percent monthly interest rate, and then stole the money that the women had invested.  She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.

The sound radiates energy, so the bubble eventually reaches equilibrium with its surroundings.     The frequency of the sound is well defined (Minnaert 1993) and depends on bubble radius, local pressure, local water density, and a geophysical constant.  The important observation is that the size of the bubble is inversely proportional to its resonance (ringing) frequency.  Larger bubbles ring at lower frequencies and smaller bubbles ring at higher frequencies.  The sound radiated is often loud and narrowly tuned in frequency (a pure tone).  But quickly, after just tens of milliseconds, a bubble in water becomes a quiet adult bubble and changes its role—it absorbs sound and is especially efficient at absorbing sound at its resonance frequency.  Naturally occurring raindrops range in size from about 300 microns in diameter (a drizzle droplet) to more than 5 millimeters in diameter (often at the beginning of a heavy downpour).  As the drop size changes, the shape of the splash changes and so does the subsequent sound production.  In laboratory and field studies (Medwin et al.	90.81292755711728

MARCO_39_1449992234-5	Key facts every expat should know about Argentina The majority of rental properties will require that you pay your monthly rent in USD, often in cash. Expats who wish to enter into a long-term rental agreement will need a “garantia”; someone who lives and owns a business in Argentina who is prepared to guarantee that all rent payments will be made.  If you cannot find a guarantor, you may be required to make all rental payments in advance.  This can be risky and expensive.  Always ensure that you have access to cash and small change.  The majority of places will only accept cash payment, and there is a distinct lack of small change throughout Argentina; if you do not have coins in your possession, you may not be able to board the bus or pay for a taxi.  If you are a foreigner, you are expected to pay cash in full for purchasing real estate.  Expatriates who generate an income abroad are not required to pay tax when they transfer the funds into Argentina.  Many employers will tell you that you do not need a work visa to work for them.  This is untrue.  Legally employers are required to register you as an employee but fail to do so because it incurs additional costs for the company in tax and social security.	90.22370376967592

The native inhabitants defended their homes and forced the European settlers out of the region by 1542.  Nearly 40 years later, Spanish colonizers returned and established a trading post.  Traders of the time, however, were penalized by the complexity of the approved trading routes (which benefitted Lima, Peru) and by the later part of the 19th century, began to promote the idea of independence from the Spanish crown.	91.19732335209846

359	142_1-3	What makes Buenos Aires the culture capital of South America?	KILT_255919-1	"Buenos Aires  Buenos Aires ( or ; ) is the capital and largest city of Argentina.  The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast.  ""Buenos Aires"" can be translated as ""fair winds"" or ""good airs"", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name ""Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre"".  The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 15.6 million.   The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district.  In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province.  The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city.  The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (""Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires""; ""CABA"")."	87.55937585583888

MARCO_25_937745370-10	Old World European customs mix with New World Latin American traditions to form a cultural heritage unique to Argentina. This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

361	142_2-2	What makes the culture of Porteños distinct from the rest of Argentina?	MARCO_32_1208243439-2	Argentine people and culture Because of the cultural and ethnic diversity of Argentina, an expansive arts, crafts, and music scene exists, particularly in the capital of Buenos Aires. There are many cinemas and galleries in major urban centers which are popular with richer, elite members of society and visiting them is regarded as something of a status symbol.  However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	86.803671766771
362	142_2-2	What makes the culture of Porteños distinct from the rest of Argentina?	MARCO_39_1259607096-5	Changes in the transportation infrastructure, mainly the  construction of railroads, facilitated the integration into the world  capitalist economy, from which Buenos Aires and other port cities  benefitted greatly. Buenos Aires, the capital, acquired such a dominance  that it led many observers to refer to it and its culture as if it were  the whole country.  The city and the rural areas surrounding it are the  source of the most powerful understanding of national identity.  The  agrarian construct of a national identity is formed by the customs and  beliefs of the gauchos of the pampas, a group that disappeared with the modernization of the  rural economy.  The urban constructs of a national culture are centered in  the city of Buenos Aires.  A dominant version portrays Argentines as  sophisticated and highly educated people of European origin.  Another urban  version highlights aspects of popular culture seen as a product of  internal and foreign immigration.  Population and wealth are unequally  distributed.  As of 2000, a third of the national population lived in  metropolitan Buenos Aires.	84.1093614550773

Gaucho is the name given to the cowboys of South American countries, which include Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.  Some people in the city areas also wear this costume, but it would be a mistake to assume that all people in Argentina always wear these types of clothes – they do not.  As with most countries, there is an eclectic mix of clothing that people wear on a day to day basis, with people following latest fashions and trends, those who wear classic clothes, and those who prefer to wear traditional outfits, or elements of traditional costumes with more modern touches.  Typical footwear in Argentina includes the alpargatas.  This is a shoe made from canvas with a rope sole.  Sometimes, the sole may be rubber.  This style of shoe comes in a wide variety of different colours and patterns.  They are very sturdy and strong and last well.  These features made these shoes very popular in particular with people who worked outdoors and needed durable footwear.  Men often wear trousers called tje bombachas de campo, although they are unisex and so may also be worn by women.	85.61098926409613

When walking around the streets, it’s common to see locals wearing jeans, t-shirts, dress pants, and blouses.  When going to work, people normally wear more formal clothing, such as slacks and formal shirts, while others wear uniforms.  School children are also required to wear uniforms in class.  Football is very popular in Argentina, so it’s also quite common to see many wear jerseys of their favorite players.  Argentina’s modern culture still clearly shows the influence of its European immigrants, but African and American-Indian influences are also evident in music and art.  Most of the locals hail from countries such as Spain, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Russia, Great Britain, Switzerland, the Middle East, and Poland.  The people are well-educated and are very proud of their country and culture in Argentina.  They are predominantly Catholic due to their Spanish heritage, which is an explanation for why their views on family and social life tend to lean toward conservatism.	78.70104259694926

Medialunas are another example since they obviously closely resemble a French croissant.  The word medialuna means “half-moon”, which describes the curved shape they have, like croissants.  Argentine medialunas are smaller than croissants, denser, slightly sweeter, and gooier.  They're often glazed with a rum-and-sugar mix but otherwise served plain.  While many Argentineans make them at home they're also available at bakeries throughout the country.  They are especially popular for breakfast – washed down with some strong coffee.  Medialunas are often served with sweet spreads like jam, dulce de leche, or chocolate.  As well as being perfect for breakfast they're also readily available for an afternoon snack when you need a hit of sugar.  Called merienda, afternoon tea in Argentina is definitely required when most people don't have dinner until 10 pm or later.  Swap out coffee with some yerba mate for a quintessential Argentinean merienda.  A plate of yummy medialunas ready to be devoured! 10.

Similarly, a form of mate is sold in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in tea bags to be drunk in a similar way to tea.  This is known in Spanish as mate cocido or cocido.  In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of merienda (roughly, afternoon tea), often with a selection of facturas (sweet pastries).  It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools.  Cultivation Yerba mate The plant is grown mainly in South America, more specifically in Northern Argentina ( Corrientes, Misiones ), Paraguay, Uruguay and southern Brazil ( Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná ).  The Guaraní are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant; the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries, who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador.  When the yerba is harvested, the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor.  Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up.	75.54966210547627

It’s simple but it’s what many people in Argentina eat.  They start their day off light.  When we ventured on our own, we had churros.  These are long pieces of fried dough covered in sugar.  In some areas, they served churros with a side of dulce de leche which is a sweet, sort of thick, caramel.  In some cafes, we had the option to order the churros filled with dulce de leche.  While delicious, it was really sweet for breakfast.  Medialunas for breakfast in Argentina After two months in Argentina, I’ve gotten used to supplementing my hostel breakfast with fruit or yogurt to satiate my American desire for something more substantial.  I especially missed protein in the morning.  However, you won’t find eggs or meat as part of an authentic Argentine breakfast.  When you are served something aside from the typical staples of coffee and either tostadas or medialunas, it’s because they are gratifying tourists.  It’s not just in cafes where I’ve found the Argentine breakfast a bit lacking.  We’ve eaten at enough breakfast-included Argentine accommodations to know it’s universal.	95.8781076767741

So does being dehydrated.  I’ve found that drinking water at every meal (and staying away from other beverages) when I’ve just arrived in a new place helps me to adjust.  Trust me.  It’s hard landing in Argentina and not drinking wine immediately, but your body will thank you for waiting a couple days.  Eat healthy snacks: Even with delicious pastries surrounding me, I try to opt for fruit, yogurt, or a smoothie.  These are sweet, filling, healthy, and good for digestion.  When in doubt, eat less: Share a dish or go for a salad or other light dish.	92.23463046221012

Argentina’s cities, landscapes, and cultural traditions make this a truly unique and fun place to visit.  Must-See Destinations The Perito Moreno Glacier in Argentina is a sight, unlike any other.  The massive glacier can be observed from up close, making you feel like you’re in Antarctica.  Argentina also boasts the tallest mountain in the Americas.  At 22,837 feet high, it’s truly a sight to see.  For the daring, you can even climb it.  In the city of Buenos Aires, there is one destination that is both beautiful and haunting.  The Plaza de Mayo is the heart of the city, but it’s also the home of a ritual in which mothers of children taken by a corrupt government years ago mourn the loss of their children.  Even though seeing something so emotional and painful is never fun, part of the power of travel is learning what people in other places experience and joining with them in it.  Argentina is a beautiful country with so many exciting things to offer.

KILT_67340-46	The unique condition of Argentina, as a country which had achieved advanced development in the early 20th century but experienced a reversal, has inspired a wealth of literature and analyses on the causes of this progressive decline. The Nobel prize-winning economist Simon Kuznets is said to have remarked that there were four types of countries: the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan and Argentina.   According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), the main difference between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier.  Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with large areas of land in Argentina.   Duncan and Fogarty (1984) argued that the key difference lies in the contrast between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina.  According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia's, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.	78.6599664496025

Between 1860 and 1930, exploitation of the rich land of the pampas strongly pushed economic growth.  During the first three decades of the 20th century, Argentina outgrew Canada and Australia in population, total income, and per capita income.  By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest state per capita.  Beginning in the 1930s, however, the Argentine economy deteriorated notably.  The single most important factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government."	75.96231314603938

401	142_5-5	What are the previously mentioned nationalities?	MARCO_10_1345225280-2	Most American versions of whipped cream add both sugar and vanilla to the cream, which is essentially the same thing. This cream is credited to the chef Francois Vatel.  At the Chateau de Chantilly, Vatel supervised a huge banquet for Louis XIV and a reported 2,000 guests, where he created the now famous cream for use in pastries.  Sadly, Vatel would not be able to enjoy the cream's later popularity; his despair over the slow cooking of the fish resulted in him committing suicide later that night.  Most Americans know Chantilly cream as whipped cream.  The creation of Chantilly cream is thus tainted by Vatel’s suicide.  Yet few remember its origins, or if they do, prepare the cream because of its popularity, and as a way to honor the terribly misguided genius of Vatel.  Today, it is used throughout Europe in various pastries like eclairs, cream puffs, and it also may top ice cream.  In the US, Chantilly cream is relatively standard.  American cooks may also use the cream in French or Italian inspired pastries, or to top, fill, or frost numerous types of cakes.  The Fruit Basket cake, a golden cake, is layered with fruit and cream, and generally also frosted with the whipped cream.	91.58875523802816

KILT_474383-1	Tourism in Argentina  Argentina is provided with a vast territory and a huge variety of climates and microclimates ranging from tundra and polar in the south to the tropical climate in the north, through a vast expanse of temperate climate and natural wonders like the Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayas, the widest river and estuary of the planet (the River Plate), the huge and very mighty Iguazú Falls, some of the flattest and wide meadows-plains of planet Earth (as the Humid Pampas, a large ocean-sea coast in the Argentine Sea), culture, customs and gastronomies famous internationally, a higher degree of development (very high compared to other Latin American countries), good quality of life and people and relatively well prepared infrastructure make this country one of the most visited of America.   Mainly for its beautiful landscapes and then for its cultural heritage, Argentina receives massive numbers of travelers.  The Argentine territory stretches from the highest peaks of the Andes in the west to colitis del Norte rivers and extensive beaches and cliffs of Argentine Sea in the east; from the tropical rainforest of the Yungas north to the valleys, glaciers, lakes and cold forests of Andean Patagonia in the south, and to Argentine Antarctica.	88.42848775576567

Argentine buds | © foundin_an_attic/Flickr Argentina is kind of lawless in many ways.  Don’t expect police to stop you driving through a red light, or give you a fine for riding your bike on the pavement.  There are no security cameras around the cities like in London, and rules exist in theory only.  There is a great freedom in Argentina that has been lost in much of the rest of the world, but of course this also comes with its drawbacks, in that often the country doesn’t run very efficiently.  But nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice!  Many people come to Argentina and stay because of the great climate.  Winters are mild, with temperatures rarely falling below about 5 degrees celsius, and summers are hot and lengthy.  There is also something very satisfying about spending summer in the southern hemisphere when everyone in the northern hemisphere is having to struggle through January!  A definite benefit to living in Argentina.  Argentina is a hotbed of culture, both independent and institutional.  It has produced some of Latin America’s most important writers, has a thriving film and theatre scene and a hugely diverse artistic culture.	86.08465704112314

MARCO_15_1930934013-7	Furthermore, a major change in Brazil’s exchange rate policy had a great impact on the Argentine economy, as Brazil was one of the country’s main trading partners. In 1998, Brazil ended its own peg to the US dollar, which resulted in a strong depreciation of the real.  This helped the Brazilian economy to recover, but had a big impact on the Argentine economy, as it reduced the competiveness of many Argentine producers.  Meanwhile, the prices of Argentina’s agricultural export products fell.  All this led to a sharp reduction in exports.  As a result, Argentina’s current account deficit rose and the country went into recession in the autumn of 1998.  Argentina maintained its peg, but this left it unable to respond to the growing economic problems, as it could not apply monetary or exchange rate policy.  In fact, as the US dollar appreciated and reached its highest level in 15 years, the currency peg became even more of a straitjacket.  Moreover, the fact that the exchange rate peg was not supported by nominal price and wage flexibility further reduced Argentina’s means to deal with the currency overvaluation and decreased the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime.  As foreign investors lost their confidence in the Argentina economy, the country faced a strong increase in borrowing costs.	90.92185188599252

WAPO_XWC7DVRLCUI6TMAR3BIAMRG4TA-3	Here’s Argentina’s secret: Every additional 100 meters (about 328 feet) of altitude decreases the average temperature by 1 degree Celsius. That means grapes with higher acidity and softer tannins.  But the intensity of the sunlight increases as well, allowing the grapes to achieve maximum ripeness while the cooler temperatures keep the sugars in check.  The combination of low temperatures and high-intensity sun yields red wines of high intensity and extraction, soft and almost imperceptible tannins, and impressive structure and balance.  Altitude is only one factor in Argentina’s reach for quality.  “Our wines are wines of the sun, but also of the soil,” says Sebastian Zuccardi, third-generation winemaker at Familia Zuccardi in Mendoza.  He is also in charge of winemaking at his family’s Santa Julia winery.  It would be easy to say the Zuccardi wines emphasize quality, while the Santa Julia label offers value, but that would be oversimplifying it.  Both lines offer value and quality.  The Zuccardi family built a new winery a few years ago in the Paraje Altamira area of the Uco Valley, about a 90-minute drive south of Mendoza.  Zuccardi uses concrete tanks for fermenting and aging his red wines, believing that way he can produce malbec that is most expressive of its terroir.	90.61238449443044

Other grape varieties which perhaps hold the most promise for Argentina's future are Bonarda and Torrontés.   Section::::History.   Argentina's wine route is still relatively new.  Although the country’s wine production dates back to the 16th century, the inclination of growth for consumption was essentially based on volume and not quality, so there was little significance placed on the art of planting vine varieties best suited to each location and its ecosystem.  Argentina’s wine industry was transformed in the 1990s when international investors had the foresight to recognize the value and untapped resource of Argentina's wine producing potential.  It has been estimated that over $1.5 billion in new vineyard investment occurred in the following decade, designed to strengthen and improve the industry's production quality.  Argentina wine regions have since undergone a radical transformation, and now rival the production quality of European wine-producing countries.    The concept of creating tourism oriented enterprises has taken form over the past decade.  Renowned architects are translating brand identity into built structures, and now numerous iconic wineries dot the landscape of Argentina’s wine regions.	87.06721915243543

MARCO_32_1208243439-2	Argentine people and culture Because of the cultural and ethnic diversity of Argentina, an expansive arts, crafts, and music scene exists, particularly in the capital of Buenos Aires. There are many cinemas and galleries in major urban centers which are popular with richer, elite members of society and visiting them is regarded as something of a status symbol.  However, a prominent feature of the culture of Argentina is their beloved tango.  An interesting fact about Argentine culture is that the dance is actually a blend of African, native American and European cultures and was actually brought to life by Argentinian people living in the working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo - a city across the Rio de la Plata in neighboring Uruguay.  From there, it spread to the upper-class dance halls of the rest of the two cities and then across the oceans to the capital cities in Europe and north to New York.	87.8689401546726

This cultural heritage can be experienced in the metropolitan city of Buenos Aires, where all facets of society and culture can be found.  With a population of about thirteen million—one-third of Argentina’s total population—Buenos Aires is a world-class city.  Argentina is an urban country: more than 90 percent of the population lives in cities.  The rural side of the culture has often been characterized as the traditional gaucho (cowboy) image of the self-reliant rancher who herds cattle and lives off the land.  Beef is a mainstay of the cuisine in much of the country.  The urban culture includes the traditional Argentine tango with music and camaraderie in upscale night clubs.  These traditional images may be stereotypes, but the cultural scene in Argentina is heavily invested in the international trends of the modern world.  The cultural landscape has become integrated with fashions and trends from across the globe.

The outmoded headquarters of what was then Argentina's second-largest newspaper, ""La Prensa"", led its influential proprietor in 1894, José Clemente Paz, to purchase a 1300 m² (14,000 ft²) lot on the newly opened Avenida de Mayo, and he commissioned local architects Carlos Agote and Alberto Gainza to design a new headquarters at the site.  Agote and Gainza, both graduates of the ""École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures"", drew from their training in Paris to create a Beaux-Arts design, beginning with a façade inspired by French architect Charles Garnier.   Completed in 1898, the new ""La Prensa"" offices was inaugurated in a ceremony attended by around 20,000.  The Beaux-Arts exterior is notable also for its spire, which is topped by a gilt bronze monument to freedom of the press represented by Pallas Athena and created by French sculptor Maurice Bouval (of Thibaut Frères).

Open banking is a concept in financial services based on several principles: the use of open APIs allowing third party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions, increased financial transparency options for account holders and the use of open source technology to achieve these principles.  Using APIs means that banking data will be available in real-time, providing consumers with better ways to conduct transactions, save and invest their money.  Consumers may also have access to better loan terms since lenders will be able to look at historical transactional data to determine a borrower’s risk level.  Open Banking also aims to give consumers better and more personalized information for making sound financial decisions.  Around the world there are pressures, both regulatory and customer-led, that are opening up the financial services market to new entrants and disrupting what and how customers buy.  In Europe, the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is set to unleash a transformation in how financial services organizations view themselves and each other.  In the United States, aggregators such as Mint.com have already dis-intermediated banks and now own the ‘last mile’ of the customer banking relationship, disrupting traditional players.	87.70556549425237

Open banking is a banking practice that provides third-party financial service providers open access to consumer banking, transaction, and other financial data from banks and non-bank financial institutions through the use of application programming interfaces (APIs).  Open banking will allow the networking of accounts and data across institutions for use by consumers, financial institutions, and third-party service providers.  Open banking is becoming a major source of innovation that is poised to reshape the banking industry.  Key Takeaways Open banking is the system of allowing access and control of consumer banking and financial accounts through third-party applications.  Open banking has the potential to reshape the competitive landscape and consumer experience of the banking industry.  Open banking raises the potential for both promising gains and grave risks to consumers as more of their data is shared more widely."	87.54212070442736

MARCO_32_1186259104-3	These aggregators combined information from several user’ accounts to store all information in one place. Unsurprisingly, customers had to share usernames and passwords for each account with these aggregators making the whole system vulnerable to privacy risks.  Early “open banking” projects were scraping data from shared sources, but the records were often incomplete and provided only a partial picture.  These projects were difficult and expensive to support: If a bank decided to redesign its application, scraping became impossible.  Open banking APIs solve that problem by providing access to standardized data in a secure manner.  Payment Services Directive Explained So, what is PSD2?  The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is a legal framework that regulates payment services through the EU and EEA (European Economic Area).  The directive supports innovation and development of an integrated payment market across Europe.  The new regulatory document was adopted in October 2015.  It was a logical extension of the original PSD, which was designed in 2007 to increase competition across the payment industry.  The new directive is focused on making cross-border payments easy and secure.  PSD2 integrates open banking and APIs with the financial business industry ecosystem.  Third parties can access customer bank account data, based on customer approval.	83.8441125084646
415	143_1-3	Awesome, good to know. How does Open Banking regulation relate to PSD2?

It does this by providing customers with the ability to share their transactional data with authorised third-party service providers either for aggregation or payment services.  It is anticipated that both aggregation and payment services will be offered by third parties to Barclay Group's customers and Barclays Group itself has launched an aggregation service.  PSD2 will also introduce new requirements to the authentication process for a number of actions customers take, including ecommerce transactions.  A failure to comply with Open Banking requirements could expose Barclays Group to regulatory sanction.  Further, the data sharing regime could mean that actions or omissions by third-party service providers could expose Barclays Group to potential financial loss from third-party fraud, misuse of customer data, litigation and reputational detriment, amongst other things.  The changes to authentication may change the fraud environment across the industry as providers implement different approaches to comply.	81.78920313471463

The use of open APIs that enable third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution.   BULLET::::2.  Greater financial transparency options for account holders ranging from open data to private data.   BULLET::::3.  The use of open-source technology to achieve the above.   Open banking, as a concept could be considered as a subspecies to the open innovation concept, a term promoted by Henry Chesbrough.  It is linked to shifts in attitudes towards the issue of data ownership illustrated by regulations such as GDPR and concepts such as the Open Data movement.   Section::::History.   In October 2015, the European Parliament adopted a revised Payment Services Directive, known as PSD2.  The new rules included aims to promote the development and use of innovative online and mobile payments through open banking.   In August 2016, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued a ruling that required the nine-biggest UK banks - HSBC, Barclays, RBS, Santander, Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank, Danske Bank, Lloyds and Nationwide - to allow licensed startups direct access to their data down to the level of transaction-account transactions.	81.71495167259127

MARCO_59_690617273-8	Platform banking, in contrast, is a digital marketplace, owned and operated by a bank or another third party, that provides banking and nonbanking services. As with open banking, sharing of customer data happens only with customers’ consent.  Moreover, platform banking also requires secure data transmission via APIs.  The premise behind platform banking is that banks can serve customer needs and offer services beyond their limited portfolios; it is a strategic response to serve customers better, engender more trust, and retain the customer relationship.  Open banking enables and amplifies platform banking.  Will the United States adopt open banking regulations?  The open data revolution is most evident in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries in the European Union.  Each has explicit regulations (Australia’s Consumer Data Right Act, 9 UK Open Banking Standard, 10 and PSD2) that require banks to share customer data with third-party providers as per customers’ instructions.  Other countries, such as Canada, Japan, and Singapore, are also considering similar regulations.  Australia, however, has taken it a step further: It has gone beyond the financial services sector, applying an expansive set of rules on consumer data rights and data-sharing to other industries as well.	94.0600737433988

Open banking The debate over access to financial data has already been hashed out in the European Union and the United Kingdom.  So-called “open banking” laws now require banks to make it easier to export your data, and pick up and move to a new bank.  Advocates say it gives non-banking start-ups the chance to compete with incumbents and gives consumers more choice over financial products and services.  Across the EU, the revised Payment Services Directive, or PSD2 requires banks to share customers’ data with each other through the same standard, known as an API.  In the U.K., the Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA has mandated that the country’s biggest banks also adopt an open banking standard.  Karen Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former head of the U.S. Small Business Administration during the Obama years, said the PNC-Venmo spat shows “how much we need to adopt opening banking” that “lets customers own their own data and permission it to be used by regulated third parties through standard protocols.”	93.56570290099262

The U.S. banking agencies have issued substantially similar rules that require global systemically important institutions (including the U.S. operations of systemically important FBOs) to amend certain qualified financial contracts (“ QFCs ”) to prohibit the immediate termination of such contracts and the exercise of certain other default rights by counterparties if the firm enters bankruptcy or a special resolution proceeding.  In 2020, the OCC provided by order an exception from the express recognition requirements of the QFC stay rule for non-U.S. subsidiaries of national banks with respect to “non-U.S. non-linked contracts” as defined in the order.  5 Bank capital and liquidity requirements Back to top U.S. banks and BHCs have long been subject to risk-based capital requirements (“ U.S. Capital Framework ”) based on standards adopted by the Basel Committee (“ Basel Framework ”), which includes both advanced approaches and standardised methodologies.  U.S. banking organisations with $250bn in total consolidated assets, or $10bn in on-balance-sheet foreign exposure, had been subject to the advanced approaches methodology as well as a capital floor established under the standardised approach.	86.10435776324448
420	143_1-7	What kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking?	MARCO_56_419159361-14	This not only suggests to organizations that there is little revenue potential, but it also mean that it would be expensive to develop such a market. Consequently, relatively few organizations invest in and experiment with new products based on the new technology brought about through technological discontinuity.  For example, When Amazon started selling books online Barnes and Nobles and other brick and mortar booksellers discounted the new technology model and now Barnes and Nobles may be on the brink of bankruptcy.  Barnes and Nobles, Borders and other bookseller also believe that not many books will want to buy books online.  How can you buy what you have not seen?  The banking industry is also another example.  Although on-line technology has existed for some time, until recently on-line product innovation in the banking industry has been slow in coming.  One cause has been the difficulty in adapting banking to on-line technology.  Banks have to develop user software application, terminal equipment, and sophisticated communications facilities to mesh the technology into a product that consumers could easily use and also be able to have enough security built into the applications to protect users and bank’s asset.  Banks probably also believed that consumers would want personal contact with a human banker, due to the relative complexity and risk associated with financial products.	80.20229953702074

A great deal of emphasis is being placed on digitizing core business processes and reassessing organizational structures and internal talent to be better prepared for the future of banking.  This transformation illustrates the increasing desire to become a ‘digital bank’.  The importance of innovation and developing new solutions that take advantage of data, advanced analytics, digital technologies and new delivery platforms has never been more important.	78.41063627548283
423	143_1-9	No, I meant what kind of product innovation has happened based on Open Banking in general?	MARCO_05_1138054887-4	historical usage of general English general (adjective and noun) comes via Old French from the Latin adjective generālis “common, belonging to all, belonging to a race or genus” (as opposed to speciālis “particular, belong to a species”). The military sense of general (noun) dates from the mid-16th century; general officer and general of the army date from the mid-17th century.  The heads of some Roman Catholic religious orders are called generals, a usage that began in the 16th century and applied originally to the Jesuits but now applies to the Franciscans and Dominicans as well; the usage was extended in the 19th century to the head of the Salvation Army.  The phrase in general originally meant “in a body, collectively” (a sense that is now obsolete), with a clear relation to the sense of the adjective general “with respect to a whole class, group, or category.”  It later developed further to mean “usually,” which can be interpreted as meaning “as a general rule (rather than a specific instance).”	96.51892054473046

MARCO_50_1983259728-100	Some examples of specific checks and balances are the idea behind the President being the “commander-in-chief”, while Congress had the ability to declare war (it’s worth nothing that the definition behind what exactly being “commander-in-chief” entailed and whether military powers were shared reciprocally or separately, along with the definition of what “declaring war” would constitute in the current status quo - does it mean simply using military force or fighting a nation formally with the intent of pretty much destroying it or something along the lines of that?), as well as the ability of Congress to create laws, while the President has the ability to veto them. This leads me to my next point which I created right now because I realized that when you said ‘constitution’, you meant a constitution in general, and not the U.S. constitution.  Basically constitutions in general are meant to set the whole structure of the government and give the people rights and whatnot.  Some example would include the Spanish, South African, British (though it’s not explicitly referred to as a constitution, but it serves the same purpose), South Korean, and even North Korean constitution.	87.07662710241857

The regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which adds to the market uncertainty.  Investing everything in a single cryptocurrency is a very bad idea, because a better version really could replace bitcoin at the top of the heap.  I'm not saying that this will happen but the risk is not zero percent.  If you're investing in cryptocurrencies today, it's probably best to divide your holdings between bitcoin and a few other respectable names such as Ethereum and Litecoin.  All the major names happen to be falling today, but their performance can vary widely from time to time.  Don't cry for the bitcoin specialists, though.  With the exception of the micro-cap Ebang International, all of them have performed extremely well during the current bitcoin boom.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust gained 347% over the last 52 weeks and MicroStrategy rose 331% over the same period.  CleanSpark's stock posted a 614% gain.  And if you thought those results were impressive, we haven't even talked about Riot Blockchain's 1,964% return or Marathon's crushing 2,374% gains.

On December 4, 2017, The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that the U.K. Treasury and the EU both had made plans aimed at ending anonymity for cryptocurrency traders, citing anti-money laundering and tax evasion crackdowns.  The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions.  Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.”  The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [  cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”  While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging.	87.32710559549741

It demonstrates great confidence in its reusable technology that SpaceX would trust reflown parts on such an important launch.  The Falcon Heavy is designed to be mostly reusable, just like individual Falcon 9 rockets.  Following the launch, all three cores can return to the surface for landing.  However, the higher speed of Falcon Heavy launches could make landing much more difficult.  The company isn’t even sure launches will be easy at first.  Musk has noted repeatedly there is a “non-zero” chance that the Falcon Heavy will explode on its maiden voyage.  Falcon Heavy at the Cape pic.twitter.com/hizfDVsU7X — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2017 Based on Musk’s photos, all the rocket is missing is the payload.  SpaceX isn’t going to put anything important on board.  Musk recently said he’d put his Tesla Roadster atop the rocket as the payload and send it to Mars, but then SpaceX told some news outlets he was joking.  Musk hasn’t really done anything to dispel the idea that he’s going to launch a car into space, though.  The Falcon heavy launch is currently scheduled for some time in January, which is not an optimal Mars transfer timeframe, by the way.	86.5227560820058

MARCO_52_1611502076-2	The two side first-stage boosters of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket come back to Earth for a pinpoint landing shortly after launching the Arabsat-6A communications satellite on April 11, 2019. (Image credit: SpaceX) SpaceX also recovered both halves of the $6 million payload fairing — the shell that protects satellites during launch — shortly after the Heavy lifted off on April 11.  The company plans to reuse the fairing and the two intact first-stage boosters, Musk has said.  SpaceX has already landed and reflown the first stages of its workhorse Falcon 9 rockets multiple times.  Such reuse is part of the company's plan to slash the cost of spaceflight, thereby making ambitious exploration feats economically feasible.  SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket is a heavy-lift booster that's the largest, most powerful privately built rocket in history.

443	144_1-1	What does SpaceX's rocket engine reusability mean and why do they care?	MARCO_09_739564359-3	The new video shows a Falcon Heavy soaring into space from the historic Launch Complex-39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. (SpaceX signed a deal with NASA to use the launch pad in 2014).  After the two side boosters separate, they turn back around and make a perfect landing, upright on a pad on Earth.  The core booster of the rocket separates from the second stage before flying back to the ground like the other two nine-engine boosters.  The rocket's second stage finishes delivering its satellite payload to orbit.  Achieving complete rocket reusability has long been a goal of SpaceX and its founder, billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, as a way of dramatically lowering the cost of spaceflight for both unmanned launches and, eventually, crewed missions.  But SpaceX still has a way to go before this kind of reusable rocket dream can become a reality.  The company recently brought the boost stage of its current Falcon 9 rocket back from space in an attempt to land it on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean.  While SpaceX did managed to return the stage back to Earth, it exploded after impacting the platform.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk later said the returning rocket ran out hydraulic fluid used to control its stabilization fins during the descent.	77.37510663247667
444	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	KILT_34666187-25	In an arrangement highly unusual for launch vehicles, SpaceX began in 2013 using some first stages of the Falcon 9 v1.1 rockets for propulsive-return controlled-descent flight tests after they completed the boost phase of an orbital flight. Since the advent of spaceflight in 1957, launch vehicle boosters would ordinarily just be discarded after setting their payloads on their way.  The over-water tests started by SpaceX took place in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans south of Vandenberg Air Force Base and east of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.  The first flight test occurred on September 29, 2013, after the second stage with the CASSIOPE and nanosat payloads separated from the booster.  These descent and simulated landing tests continued over the next two years, with the second flight test taking place on April 18, 2014, two more test in 2014, and four subsequent tests conducted in 2015.  SpaceX continued to make iterative and incremental changes to the booster design, as well as the specific reusable technologies, descent profile and propellant margins, on some 2016-2018 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy flights to tweak the design and operational parameters.  Many of these descent and landing tests were tested on active orbital spaceflight missions for SpaceX customers as the booster reentered the atmosphere and attempted recoverable landings.	84.13309428771026

Falcon 9 v1.0 made five flights in 2010–2013, when it was retired.  Falcon 9 v1.1 SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft, lifts off during the COTS Demo Flight 1 on 8 December 2010 Main article: Falcon 9 v1.1 On 8 September 2005, SpaceX announced the development of the Falcon 9 rocket, which has nine Merlin engines in its first stage.  The design is an EELV -class vehicle, intended to compete with the Delta IV and the Atlas V, along with launchers of other nations as well.  Both stages were designed for reuse.  A similarly designed Falcon 5 rocket was also envisioned to fit between the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9, but development was dropped to concentrate on the Falcon 9.  The first version of the Falcon 9, Falcon 9 v1.0, was developed in 2005–2010, and flew five orbital missions in 2010–2013.  The second version of the launch system— Falcon 9 v1.1 — has been retired meanwhile.  Falcon 9 v1.1 was developed in 2010-2013, and made its maiden flight in September 2013.	79.86196074169129
446	144_1-3	When did people first start caring about rocket engine reusability?	MARCO_18_3116878569-7	In March 2013, SpaceX announced that it would instrument and equip subsequent Falcon 9 first-stages as controlled descent test vehicles, with plans for over-water propulsively decelerated simulated landings beginning in 2013, with the intent to return the vehicle to the launch site for a powered landing—possibly as early as mid-2014. The April 2013 draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed SpaceX South Texas Launch Site includes specific accommodations for return of the Falcon 9 first-stage boosters to the launch site.  Elon Musk first publicly referred to the reusable Falcon 9 as the Falcon 9-R in April 2013.  In September 2013, SpaceX successfully relit three engines of a spent booster on an orbital launch, and the booster re-entered the atmosphere at hypersonic speed without burning up.  With the data collected from the first flight test of a booster-controlled descent from high altitude, coupled with the technological advancements made on the Grasshopper low-altitude landing demonstrator, SpaceX announced it believed it was ready to test a full land-recovery of a booster stage.  Based on the positive results from the first high-altitude flight test, SpaceX advanced the expected date of a test from mid-2014 to early 2015, with the intention of doing so on the next Space Station cargo resupply flight pending regulatory approvals.	79.78847648994997
447	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_26_1067160456-2	While the first stage of this rocket is reusable, the upper stage is not. Another problem with Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rocket is it’s not rapidly reusable.  After every flight, this rocket needs extensive refurbishment before SpaceX can use it again.  The primary reason is the fuel of the Falcon rocket is Kerosene (RP-1).  The burnt fuel leaves soot in the Merlin engine compartment, making it harder to reuse it without extensive cleaning.  SpaceX’s Mars Plan: As we mentioned earlier, Elon Musk wants to go to Mars.  A spaceship will take more than 6 months to reach Mars from Earth.  The round trip is 12 months.  We know that the Mars atmosphere has CO2 and has frozen water in the ground.  On Mars, we can create Methane (CH4) using these resources.  First, through electrolysis, we can split water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).  2H2O = O2 + 2H2 Oxygen and Hydrogen will be collected in separate containers.  Humans will use the Oxygen produced in this step.  On the next step, through a chemical process known as the Sabatier process, Carbon dioxide (CO2) and Hydrogen (H2) would create Methane (CH4).	92.25972621695836
448	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_01_686831562-18	76] Technical feasibility Prior to the reusability program's success in December 2015, the return of an orbital launch system booster rocket had never been accomplished, and many questioned both technical and economic feasibility. And even after this success, the rapid reuse of a rocket has not been attempted.  Developing a reusable rocket is extremely challenging due to the small percentage of a rocket's mass that can make it to orbit.  [  6  ]  [  77] Typically, a rocket's payload is only about 3% of the mass of the rocket which is also roughly the amount of mass in fuel that is required for the vehicle's re-entry.  [  78] Elon Musk said at the beginning of the program that he believed the return, vertical landing and recovery was possible because the SpaceX manufacturing methodologies result in a rocket efficiency exceeding the typical 3% margin.  A SpaceX rocket operating in the reusable configuration has approximately 30% less payload lift capacity than the same rocket in an expendable configuration.  Although the reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets [  28] it is particularly well suited to the Falcon Heavy where the two outer cores separate from the rocket earlier in the flight, and are therefore moving more slowly at stage separation.	87.97465658414876
449	144_1-5	What made the space shuttle so hard to reuse?	MARCO_23_1123984842-4	Reusability – Rockets are designed to have two or three “stages”. The first stage is the actual rocket.  The rocket detaches itself from the rest of the ship and doesn’t actually make it to orbit.  The problem is most rockets are only designed for single-use.  Once it does its job of propelling the payload into orbit, it becomes a very expensive, gigantic tin can.  Very few parts of the rocket are salvaged and reused for the next launch.  Reusable rockets will help reduce costs of space launches significantly but they are complex to build and design so it might take a while to perfect them.  SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is the first system that has managed to have a reusable first-stage.  Development cost – There’s little room for error when it comes to launching things into space.  One small error will put lives and millions of dollars in expensive equipment in danger.  More importantly, human lives.  Designing and building rockets is a big challenge and one that must not be taken lightly.  This is why thousands and thousands of hours have to go into developing the technology and materials that make space travel possible.  Then, all that needs to be tested and re-tested many times on the ground.	81.80926132452441

KILT_34666187-1	SpaceX reusable launch system development program  The SpaceX reusable launch system development program is a privately funded program to develop a set of new technologies for an orbital launch system that may be reused many times in a manner similar to the reusability of aircraft.  The company SpaceX is developing the technologies over a number of years to facilitate full and rapid reusability of space launch vehicles.  The project's long-term objectives include returning a launch vehicle first stage to the launch site in minutes and to return a second stage to the launch pad following orbital realignment with the launch site and atmospheric reentry in up to 24 hours.  SpaceX's long term goal is that both stages of their orbital launch vehicle will be designed to allow reuse a few hours after return.   The program was publicly announced in 2011.  SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015.  The first re-flight of a landed first stage occurred in March 2017 with the second occurring in June 2017, that one only five months after the maiden flight of the booster.  The third attempt occurred in October 2017 with the SES-11/EchoStar-105 mission.  Second flights of refurbished first stages then became routine.   The reusable launch system technology was developed and initially used for the first stages of the Falcon family of rockets.	90.77622783672996

MARCO_18_3116878569-9	"In June 2014, COO Gwynne Shotwell clarified that all funding for development and testing of the reusable launch system technology development program is private funding from SpaceX, with no contribution by the US government. As of 2017 SpaceX had spent over a billion dollars on the development program.  For the first time, SpaceX stated in July 2014 that they are ""highly confident of being able to land successfully on a floating launch pad or back at the launch site and refly the rocket with no required refurbishment.""  By late 2014, SpaceX suspended or abandoned the plan to recover and reuse the Falcon 9 second stage; the additional mass of the required heat shield, landing gear, and low-powered landing engines would incur too great a performance penalty.  While the idea was mentioned again later it was ultimately abandoned as Starship development made progress.  In December 2015, following the recovery of the first stage from December 22 launch, SpaceX projected that the first reflight of a recovered booster would likely occur in 2016, but that their plan was to not refly the December 22 recovered stage for that purpose.  In September 2016, SpaceX announced that development was underway to extend the reusable flight hardware to second stages, a more challenging engineering problem because the vehicle is travelling at orbital velocity."	70.15316139906645

Use of Merlin engines RP-1, a petroleum derivative similar to kerosene and liquid oxygen as materials to produce rocket propulsion.  The Falcon 9 takes its name from the nine Merlin engines used.  According to the technical data of the Falcon 9, which takes its name from the nine Merlin engines used, these engines have a thrust of 650 kN, a Specific vacuum pulse 311s and a 63.5 ton rise in sea level.  Design details for the Merlin 1D engine were not openly shared by SpaceX, but the company said the Falcon 9 was « the world’s most powerful operational rocket.  , by a factor of two ”.  In November 2013, Elon Musk explained that the engine was running at 85% of its potential and that these numbers could be improved.  The result came with the Falcon 9 v1.1, which in addition to changing the placement of the nine engines, has evolved into the Merlin 1D empty.

In the SpaceX post, I talked about the Falcon 9’s nine Merlin engines, and how each one was powerful enough to lift a stack of 40 cars up into the sky—in total, that meant the Falcon 9 set of engines could lift 360 cars.  The Falcon Heavy, with its 27 Merlin engines, could lift a stack of over 1,000 cars up past the clouds.  2 The Big Fucking Booster sits atop a different kind of engine: the Raptor.  The Raptor engine looks a lot like a Merlin, with one key difference—by significantly increasing the pressure, SpaceX has made the Raptor over three times more powerful than a Merlin.  A single Raptor engine produces 310 tons of thrust—enough to lift 310 tons, or a stack of 172 cars, or an entire Boeing 747 airplane, into the sky.  That’s what one Raptor can do.  3 And the BFB has 42 of them.  4 All together, that’s an unheard of 13,033 tons of thrust, enough to push more than 7,000 cars—or 50 large airplanes—up to space.	72.67854980332777
456	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067160456-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Methane in Starship.  SpaceX’s new Starship and Super Heavy rocket uses the Raptor engine.  Liquid Methane and Oxygen is the fuel of this engine.  No other rockets have ever used Methane as rocket fuel.  The Falcon 9 and Falcon heavy use kerosene (RP-1) as fuel.  Moreover, for a long time, Hydrogen has been used in various rockets.  But, SpaceX chose Methane for their Raptor.  So why does SpaceX use Methane?  It’s because Methane (CH4) is cheap, a passive cooling system is enough to store Methane in liquid form, significantly denser than Hydrogen, storable for a more extended period, does not leak, does not require insulation on the fuel tank, and the rocket design is less complex compared to Hydrogen-powered rocket.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX has developed the Raptor.  It’s a Methane powered full-flow staged combustion cycle engine.  The Raptor engine is the first-ever in history, a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine ever flown on a rocket.  No rocket engine that uses Methane has ever reached orbit except SpaceX rockets.  SpaceX’s Starship is a rapidly reusable Mars rocket.  The Falcon rockets are not fully reusable.	93.16903645027196
457	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_26_1067150539-1	Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  | ProVsCons SpaceX Here’s why SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon rockets.  SpaceX’s newest rocket, Starship, uses Methane (CH4) and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) as fuel.  However, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy uses rocket-grade Kerosene (RP-1) and LOX as a propellant.  So, why does SpaceX use Kerosene?  SpaceX uses Kerosene in Falcon Rockets because up until 2007; there were no Methane engines.  And Kerosene is cheaper, denser, stable at room temperature.  It’s easy to handle, is not toxic like hypergolic propellent, easily transportable, and has no leakage issue similar to Liquid Hydrogen (LH2).  It also has a higher energy density and presents a lower explosion hazard than LH2, and Kerosene rocket engines produce more thrust per dollar.  Let’s elaborate.  SpaceX’s Goal: Since childhood, Elon Musk has been fascinated by space and rockets.  When Elon Musk made some money during the PayPal sale to eBay, he wanted to buy a rocket to send a greenhouse to Mars.  However, soon he found that all the commercial rockets were too expensive because none were reusable.  So, he invested $100 million and formed SpaceX. SpaceX’s primary goal is to make human life multi-planetary.	86.51730465248693
458	144_2-5	How come Spacex is using methane as their new rocket engine propellant?	MARCO_17_3581880174-11	Methane In November 2012, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk announced plans to develop liquid methane /LOX rocket engines. It had previously used only RP-1 /LOX in SpaceX rocket engines.  As of March 2014  [  update] , SpaceX was developing the Raptor methalox bipropellant rocket engine, which by 2016 was predicted to generate 3,000 kN (670,000 lbf) of thrust.  The engine is slated to be used on a future super-heavy rocket, the Starship.  Although it has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen, liquid methane can be produced on Mars via the Sabatier reaction and is easier to store than liquid hydrogen due to its higher boiling point and density, as well as its lack of hydrogen embrittlement.  It also leaves less residue in the engines compared to kerosene, which is beneficial for reusability.  In July 2014, Firefly Space Systems announced their plans to use methane fuel for their small satellite launch vehicle, Firefly Alpha with an aerospike engine design.  In September 2014, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance announced the joint development of the BE-4 LOX/LNG engine.  The BE-4 will provide 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) of thrust.

459	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-6	Therefore, a Methane powered rocket would be lighter compared to a Hydrogen rocket. Hydrogen is the smallest molecule on earth.  It leaks easily, primarily through the welded joints of the fuel tanks.  Therefore, it needs extraordinary precision and cares to make the fuel tank leak proof.  Methane does not have this leak issue.  Hydrogen is also expensive compared to Methane (CH4).  As we can see, though Hydrogen is more efficient, it has many drawbacks.  Therefore, SpaceX needs a rocket engine that does not have these issues.  When they first started designing an engine, SpaceX did not want to take any risk of creating a completely new type of engine that no one developed.  Therefore, they decided to use Kerosene (RP-1) for their Falcon family rockets.  When they were successful with their Marlin engine, they started their R&D for the Methane powered Raptor.  In short, liquid Hydrogen needs extreme temperature control, leaks easily, less dense, thus requires a bigger fuel tank, expensive compared to Methane, not suitable for a reusable rocket and Mars mission, needs advanced metallurgy; hence, it increases rocket complexity and cost.  Therefore, SpaceX made the right decision by not developing a Hydrogen rocket engine.  Interesting Findings: How much does Elon Musk own of SpaceX?	92.3665424720748
460	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_18_3116444373-12	"Jeff Thornburg, who led development of the Raptor engine at SpaceX 2011–2015, noted that methane rocket engines have higher performance than kerosene/RP-1 and lower than hydrogen, with significantly fewer problems for long-term, multi-start engine designs than kerosene—methane is cleaner burning—and significantly lower cost than hydrogen, coupled with the ability to ""live off the land"" and produce methane directly from extraterrestrial sources. SpaceX successfully began development testing of injectors in 2014 and completed a full-power test of a full-scale oxygen preburner in 2015.  76 hot fire tests of the preburner, totaling some 400 seconds of test time, were executed from April–August 2015.  SpaceX completed its planned testing using NASA Stennis facilities in 2014 and 2015.  In January 2015, Elon Musk stated that the thrust they were currently targeting was around 230 tonnes-force (2,300 kN; 510,000 lb f ), much lower than older statements had mentioned.

461	144_2-7	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_26_1067160456-5	It’s melting point is -259°C or -435°F, and its boiling point is -252°C or -423°F. Hydrogen needs to be stored in extremely cold temperatures to keep it in liquid form.  Because of this, a hydrogen rocket needs insulation around tanks, thus increasing rocket weight, production complexity, and cost.  Furthermore, other problems arise because of the Hydrogen’s low boiling point.  On a long trip to the Moon and Mars, the Hydrogen will boil off and evaporate.  Moreover, during the earth’s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L. As a result, a Hydrogen rocket’s fuel tank needs to be significantly bigger than a Methane powered rocket.  A big tank means a heavier rocket.	84.82760423922446

This was pre-compressor cooling, albeit available for relatively short duration.  Hydrogen-fuelled air-breathing jet engines Jet engines can be run on almost any fuel.  Hydrogen is a highly desirable fuel, as, although the energy per mole is not unusually high, the molecule is very much lighter than other molecules.  The energy per kg of hydrogen is twice that of more common fuels and this gives twice the specific impulse.  In addition, jet engines running on hydrogen are quite easy to build—the first ever turbojet was run on hydrogen.  Also, although not duct engines, hydrogen-fueled rocket engines have seen extensive use.  However, in almost every other way, hydrogen is problematic.  The downside of hydrogen is its density; in gaseous form the tanks are impractical for flight, but even in the form of liquid hydrogen it has a density one fourteenth that of water.  It is also deeply cryogenic and requires very significant insulation that precludes it being stored in wings.  The overall vehicle would end up being very large, and difficult for most airports to accommodate.  Finally, pure hydrogen is not found in nature, and must be manufactured either via steam reforming or expensive electrolysis.	81.79237159014883
464	144_2-9	Why are hydrogen-based rocket engines difficult to build?	MARCO_06_603902257-3	"These make hydrogen engines particularly prone to pre-ignition. The situation is further aggravated by hydrogen's high flame speed.  Pre-ignition leads to harmful flashbacks into the carburetor and rough operation and is believed to be due to the development of surface ""hot spots.""  Induction ignition can occur due to excessive temperatures of both combustion chamber components and small surface deposits or suspended particles.  Hydrogen's exceptionally low ignition energy requires that the average temperature prevailing within the combustion space during induction be sufficiently low so that the formation of hot spots is avoided.  This requires appropriate cooling of the cylinder head, piston, valves, combustion chamber wall, and the use of cold spark plugs (non-platinum tipped spark plugs).  One way to reduce the effect of combustion chamber hot spots on the pre-ignition of a fresh charge is to use thermal dilution techniques.  The unusual heat and mass transfer characteristics of hydrogen make it almost necessary to rethink the combustion chamber and cooling system design so that hydrogen's unique attributes can be capitalized on to full advantage.  Another important issue regarding the engine operation, especially with near stoichiometric hydrogen and air mixtures, is the extent of NOx formation."	78.79458603064995

Section::::History.   In the first ten years of SpaceX, the company developed a variety of liquid-propellant rocket engines, with at least one more of that type under development.   , each of the engines developed to date—Kestrel, Merlin 1, Draco and Super Draco—had been developed for initial use in the SpaceX Falcon family of launch vehicles—Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy—or for the Dragon capsule.  Each main engine developed by 2012 has been Kerosene-based, using RP-1 as the fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX) as the oxidizer, while the RCS control thruster engines have used storable hypergolic propellants.   In November 2012, at a meeting of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London, United Kingdom, SpaceX announced that they plan to develop methane-based engines for their future rockets.  These engines will use staged cycle combustion, for higher efficiency similar to the system used on the former Soviet Union's NK-33 engine.   By mid-2015, SpaceX had developed a total of 9 rocket engines architectures in the first 13 years of the company's existence.	87.29903819365427

However, Elon Musk does not want to rush with IPO this time.  According to Elon Musk, all the achievements of SpaceX is a background for his biggest dream – an expedition to Mars.  SpaceX is in designing process of Mars Colonial Transporter.  Also, Musk’s engineers work on innovative rocket engines (Grasshopper and the Falcon 9 rockets) and Red Dragon spacecraft that using Falcon Heavy rockets (modified version of Dragon capsule) to transport people from Earth to Mars.  He once said, “I would like to die on Mars, just not on impact.”  Falcon Heavy rocket flight animation: Grasshopper and Falcon 9 are experimental launch vehicles that are able to make vertical landings and vertical takeoffs.

Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines — Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor for use in launch vehicles, Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft, and SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon .  Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants in a gas-generator power cycle.  Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage, and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.  The Merlin engine uses a pintle injector that provides deep-throttle capability used during Falcon 9 landings.  Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impeller turbopump .  Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine.  It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump, and is fed only by tank pressure.  The engine is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, and is radiatively cooled on the exhaust nozzle.  The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.	82.43277684180066

MARCO_17_3580319373-22	A number of tradeoffs arise from this selection, some of which include: Tradeoff comparison among popular engine cycles  Cycle type Gas generator Expander cycle Staged-combustion Pressure-fed Advantages Simple; low dry mass; allows for high power turbopumps for high thrust High specific impulse; fairly low complexity High specific impulse; high combustion chamber pressures allowing for high thrust Simple; no turbopumps; low dry mass; high specific impulse Disadvantages Lower specific impulse Must use cryogenic fuel; heat transfer to the fuel limits available power to the turbine and thus engine thrust Greatly increased complexity &, therefore, mass (more-so for full-flow) Tank pressure limits combustion chamber pressure and thrust; heavy tanks and associated pressurization hardware Cooling Main article: Rocket engine cooling Injectors are commonly laid out so that a fuel-rich layer is created at the combustion chamber wall.  This reduces the temperature there, and downstream to the throat and even into the nozzle and permits the combustion chamber to be run at higher pressure, which permits a higher expansion ratio nozzle to be used which gives a higher ISP and better system performance.  A liquid rocket engine often employs regenerative cooling, which uses the fuel or less commonly the oxidizer to cool the chamber and nozzle.	95.34103365067858

You can get away with smaller propellant tanks with ion engines, but you need a dense, high power source of electricity.  You can get a lot more thrust for a given energy input with electrothermal or chemical engines, but you need much bigger propellant tanks.  A photon rocket would be the most mass efficient, least energy efficient option...no propellant needed, but enormous amounts of power required to produce any useful thrust.  Photon sails use an external source of light so they don't have to carry around a massive power source and insanely bright light source, instead carrying a lightweight reflective sail, and are rather more practical than photon rockets.  They may use sunlight, but will also work with laser beams that could be produced electrically at a fixed installation.  Jul 7, 2010 #19 Lsos 803 9 I was wondering about the whole photon rocket concept...if matter/antimatter annihilation produces pure energy, wouldn't it be more practical to simply annihilate matter/antimatter (or even detonate a nuclear bomb) inside some sort of mirror-lined combustion chamber, instead of going through the whole nuclear reaction-electricity-preposterously bright flashlight process?	85.02607825695304
474	144_2-17	Why do open cycle rocket engines exhaust fuel?	MARCO_19_1767990244-25	Due to the laws of thermodynamics, as air is compressed, it is heated up. The air in the bow shock compresses so much it actually turns into a plasma.  This plasma can be about half as hot as the surface of the Sun.  Superheavy Bowshock So in order to avoid having this burning hot plasma destroy the rocket, the Falcon 9 will again light up 3 of its 9 Merlin engines to slow itself down just as it begins to really experience those extreme atmospheric temperatures.  This not only slows the booster down, but it also basically creates a “force field” in front of the booster, providing a boundary of exhaust gas which is a lot cooler than the plasma.  Without this step, the Falcon 9 booster would likely not survive the reentry process.  Parachute recovery attempts After all, SpaceX tried to recover the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 boosters using parachutes for the first few flights, which kept failing, likely due to a complete lack of additional heat shielding.  By the time the booster was supposed to deploy the parachutes it was too late.  Because it is hard to deploy parachutes when you are in a million flaming pieces.  But again as we mentioned before, this is something that stainless steel should allow the SuperHeavy booster to forgo which will save fuel and thereby increase overall performance.	89.56487920577638

MARCO_22_1413901484-2	"This means that both engines have roughly the same outer dimensions: the 429 is 34 inches by 30 inches by 30 inches, and the 460 is 34 inches by 27 inches by 30 inches. These massive engines certainly weighed plenty, however.  The 429 weighed in at 635 pounds, while the 460 was an incredible 720 pounds, living up to its ""big block"" heritage.  Obviously, the physical size of the engine displacement is reflected in the names of the engines.  Production Run Though both engines began their lives in 1968, the 429 was discontinued in 1973, while the 460 lasted all the way until 1996, seeing use exclusively in trucks.  However, in 1973, the 460 underwent a massive change, dropping from a robust 365 horsepower to a paltry 209 horsepower.  It was finally discontinued due to demands for a more efficient engine to respond to the newly environmentally aware consumers.  Stroke Length This is where most of the difference between the engines is made up.  The 429, with less displacement volume, had a shorter stroke length of 3.59, meaning it produced less power per camshaft rotation than the 460, which had a stroke length of 3.85, as mentioned above.  The longer stroke produces more power and also allows for more and better high-performance modifications."	95.00754804652024

But, due to the simple fact that they’re sedans, they don’t have that much room, especially compared to the roomiest Honda models like the Odyssey.  CarGurus says that both cars can seat five people and both offer roughly similar front and back legroom at about 40 inches.  Both of their engines are also almost the same despite different horsepower outputs.  CarGurus says that both have a gas-powered 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine.  What’s different between the two?  The Honda Accord | Raymond Boyd/Getty Images While the Honda Accord and the Civic have a lot in common, the Accord is still a larger sedan than the Civic is.  As a result, a lot of their differences are a result of that size difference.  For instance, despite having engines that are the same size, the Accord’s engine is more powerful than the Civic’s.  CarGurus says that the Accord’s engine gets 192 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque, while the Civic gets 174 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque.	88.64758280932438

Verdict Now that we have researched and then compared notes about the 5.7 Hemi engine and the 6.4 model, we can now finally make an informed verdict about who is the ultimate ruler between the two.  As we can clearly see from the comparison above, the 6.4 engine dominates the 5.7 engine in terms of stroke, cc, horsepower, torque, and overall performance.  Even in the physical sections such as weight, we can declare the 6.4 engine to be the ultimate ruler!  Final Words We do have to note that, even though the 6.4 engine has come out as the winner of the competition between the two, both of them are wonderfully built machines, and choosing either one of them should be totally based on their applications and usage.  We hope this concise discussion about the two engines can help you make that choice.	83.25854997365968
480	145_1-1	What is happening to the corals?	MARCO_45_1316021768-7	"The increasing acidification of the ocean — caused when oceans absorb immense amounts of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels — inhibits coral's ability to produce the calcium carbonate exoskeletons they rely on for shelter. Water pollution, too, is wreaking havoc on coral reefs.  Agricultural pesticides and fertilizers, oil and gasoline, sewage discharge and sediment from eroded landscapes make it difficult for coral to thrive, and therefore damage the complex relationships that exist among the plants, coral and other animals that are part of the reef ecosystem.  As the temperatures of the world's oceans increase due to global warming, coral polyps expel the zooxanthellae they depend on for food.  Once the zooxanthellae are gone, the coral loses its brilliant color, and all that can be seen is the white exoskeleton; this is referred to as coral bleaching.  Coral colonies subject to bleaching usually die off, according to CORAL.  Fishing practices such as cyanide fishing (spraying cyanide in the water stuns the fish to make them easier to catch), ""blast fishing"" with explosives and overfishing with trawlers can destroy a thousand-year-old coral reef in a matter of minutes."	78.34138046577573
481	145_1-1	What is happening to the corals?	WAPO_1112cdb110c2098c16f02f42997e49ba-1	The coral reefs of the world are in serious danger.  A recent scientific report on corals in the Caribbean Sea, for instance, found that coral cover declined from 34.8 percent to 16.3 percent from 1970 to 2012.  One of the chief threats to corals is climate change.  Not only do warmer waters stress the species, leading to bleaching events like the one pictured above.  Climate change provides a double blow to corals because it also brings on ocean acidification, driven by increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (caused by the burning of fossil fuels) dissolved in seawater.  As sea waters acidify, corals have a harder time producing calcium carbonate, which is crucial to reef formation.  That’s why, in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of researchers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology now tentatively propose something that they admit is “extremely novel” in conservation circles.  Namely, they suggest that humans may need to intervene in the breeding of corals so as to “assist” their evolution.  Such “anthropogenically enhanced” corals may survive better, the researchers suggest, in a world of warming and acidifying seas.	77.1341755958274
482	145_1-1	What is happening to the corals?	WAPO_01dc24dcada1488013fffd3a27464e3d-1	When coral gets too hot, the animal does something strange — it bleaches.  The small algal cells that live within the coral tissue and give reefs their vibrant colors are ejected, leaving behind an underwater scene that is bone white and sickly.  For what they say is the first time, scientists have witnessed the coral bleaching behavior.  It is a violently shuddering motion, akin to a pulsing heart.  Caught on microscope and camera, the result is a mesmerizing, if visually haunting, example of what is happening to coral reefs around the globe.  A team of coral experts at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia placed coral specimens in aquariums and heated up the water temperature, mimicking the process in parts of the nearby sea.  As the water heats up, the coral react by expelling the symbiotic algae.  “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts,” said Queensland University of Technology’s Brett Lewis in a statement.  Lewis and his colleague Luke Nothdurft published their observations recently in the journal Coral Reefs.  Coral provide shelter for the tiny photosynthesizing organisms, which in turn produce excess sugar that the animals can eat.  Without that food supply, coral may starve.	73.51692561618984

This is how it’s been for millions of years, and coral reefs have survived throughout the ages without any outside influence.  However, as humans took over the planet, we’ve overextended ourselves, and through pollution, overfishing and extensive building, we have all but decimated the Earth’s resources – including a vital resource known as coral reefs.  So, what happens when coral reefs die, exactly?  Because of climate change, El Nino events and other factors leading to the fast decline of coral reef populations, we can observe the process in real time.  Coral reefs don’t normally die by natural means.  In fact, science has taught us that senescence has not been observed in stony coral polyps, so these corals can theoretically keep renewing itself by adding new layers of tissue and leaving behind old tissue.  However, corals are not immortal, since they can die as a result of bleaching or being severely damaged.	91.4947954332456

Conservation By: Eva Gruber With the recent tragic news of the Great Barrier Reef experiencing the largest mass coral bleaching event ever, we can no longer ignore the fact that coral reefs the world over are in sheer danger.  Coral reef ecosystems take centuries to grow and develop, and it is no small matter to be losing them due to anthropogenic activities in a matter of years.  At least 19% of the world’s coral reefs – including 50% of those in the Caribbean – are already gone, and within 20 years, if current trends continue, we could lose another 15%, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.  Image Credit: http://all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/coral-reef-bleaching-after.jpg If climate change continues unabated, all the coral reefs on the planet could be gone within one human generation.  That means all the global coral reef system – with all of its biodiversity and fisheries supporting millions of poor people around the world – will be wiped out.  There will be cascading effects on the rest of the ocean’s marine habitats as well, and as a result there will be widespread hunger, poverty, and political instability.	76.25822144374251
485	145_1-3	What happens when all corals die?

This what-if question is not some farfetched scenario.  The threats to coral and coral reefs — which include climate change, pollution, coastal development, fishing and the creation of jewelry and souvenirs — are very real.  In fact, live, growing coral on Caribbean reefs has declined to just 8 percent of the reefs' composition, compared with more than 50 percent in the 1970s [  source: IUCN Facts ].  So what happens if the coral reefs vanish completely?  Some experts predict hunger, poverty and political instability as the livelihoods of the peoples of entire countries disappear.  Once the coral is dead, the reefs will also die and erode, destroying important marine life spawning and feeding grounds.  Animals that rely on coral for protection and cover, such as grouper, snapper, oysters and clams, would also be negatively impacted.  And because this marine life is a vital staple in many peoples' diets, the death of the coral reefs would exacerbate the problem of feeding these groups [  source: Skoloff ].	75.01528786309063
486	145_1-5	What is the impact of dead corals on humans?	MARCO_16_3676861391-25	The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.  The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.  Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.  Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who produce shells and skeletons, such as mussels and barnacles, and coral reefs; coral reefs have seen extensive bleaching after heat waves.  Harmful algae bloom enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of marine life.  Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.  Climate change impacts on the environment Ecological collapse.  Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide.  Extreme weather.

But far less attention has been paid to heat waves over the ocean, which can have consequences of their own for both the marine environment and people.  “This increase in marine heat waves is having devastating impacts on coral reefs around the world,” said Mark Eakin, a coral reefs specialist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Eakin said damage to reefs from these heat waves was first seen in 1983 in coral bleaching events, which have increased in frequency and intensity.  In fact, Eakin and colleagues published a study in January that found coral reefs are bleaching four to five times as frequently as they did three decades ago.  In 2014, sea surface temperatures in the northeast Pacific Ocean were 5 to 6 degrees above normal, and marine biologists were stunned by the onslaught of outsider species up and down the West Coast of the United States.  Among those spotted were a live ocean sunfish and warm-water blue shark in the Gulf of Alaska, mahi mahi off the coast of Oregon, a Pacific sea turtle common in the Galapagos near San Francisco, and marlin in the waters off Southern California.	87.83782118081581

489	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_08_339400141-2	Much of the disagreement turns on where carbon in the corals is coming from. Roark, currently at Texas A&M University in College Station, now claims to have confirmed his earlier results by looking closely at how the corals obtain their carbon.  Carbon capture and storage When growing their skeletons, corals use carbon that is found as either dissolved inorganic carbon or particulate organic carbon in the surrounding waters.  As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed — allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves — giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.	93.43529100415252
490	145_1-7	Do corals capture carbon?	MARCO_58_1622110619-2	In addition to these opportunities, a range of ocean-based carbon removal approaches could help capture and store billion of tons of carbon. Importantly, these approaches would not increase ocean acidification.  The ocean currently absorbs just under one-third of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, which is contributing to a rise in ocean acidification and making it more difficult for organisms like oysters and corals to build shells.  A few options for increasing the ocean’s capacity to store carbon may also provide co-benefits, such as increasing biodiversity and reducing acidification.  However, many approaches remain contentious due to uncertainties around potential ecological impacts, governance and other risks.  If research efforts increase to improve understanding in these areas, a combination of approaches could help address the global climate crisis.  Ocean-based Ways to Remove CO 2 from the Atmosphere Proposed methods for increasing the ocean’s ability to remove and store carbon dioxide — including biological, chemical and electrochemical concepts — vary in technical maturity, permanence, public acceptance and risk.  Note: This graphic represents the general types of proposed approaches, but may not reflect every proposal.  1.

MARCO_20_666561210-3	As we’ve mentioned, calcium carbonate is one of the ways that CO2 is taken out of the ocean, and that is because it becomes apart of shells, corals and other marine life. When any of these die, they end up on the ocean floor.  So over millions and millions of years, the dead marine life moves with the tectonic plates.  Under heat and pressure, this calcium carbonate ends up becoming rocks (such as limestone), so we end up with a lot of CO2 eventually ending up in stone.  So to sum: CO2 ends up in the oceans (which is already where most of it is contained), some gets formed into shells and corals which end up as stone or fuel (organic matter over millions of years), and by using this organic matter we’re pumping it back into the atmosphere.  As such, it seems quite reasonable that we should just be able to pump it back into the oceans to help keep this cycle continuing for millions of years more.  However, we’ve found that an increase in CO2 levels in the ocean increases the pH levels.  For anyone that has ever had a tropical fish in a tank, they well understand how important it is to keep the correct pH levels.

MARCO_36_1480232399-5	The final stage of the pump is when these clusters of dead phytoplankton reach the ocean floor where they, and the CO2 they contain, remain for thousands of years. Role of Calcium Carbonate Calcium Carbonate is the primary ingredient that Clams, oysters, coral, and other hard-bodied aquatic creatures depend on to create their hard shells.  This carbon compound is produced by carbon dioxide combining with calcium that has previously been dissolved in seawater.  When these organisms die, their body parts and shells sink deep into the ocean to the seafloor, thus hiding, or burying, carbon.  Over a long period of time, these dead organisms create carbonate-rich deposit layers on the floor of the ocean.  After millions of years have passed, more and more carbonates form, which then creates heat and pressure that causes them to turn into sedimentary rocks.  This includes chalk, marble, and limestone.  Examples of Natural Carbon Sinks Now that you know the three basics, here a just a few of the many natural carbon sinks found throughout the globe.	85.50290319498163

Ask what your dive shop, boating store, tour operators, hotel and other coastal businesses are doing to save the coral reefs.  This is especially important in coastal areas with reefs.  Let them know you are an informed consumer and care about reefs.  2  . Don't use chemically enhanced pesticides and fertilizers.  Although you may live thousands of miles from a coral reef ecosystem, these products end up in the watershed and may ultimately impact the waters that support coral.  3. Volunteer for a reef cleanup.  You don't live near a coral reef?  Then do what many people do with their vacation: visit a coral reef.  Spend an afternoon enjoying the beauty of one of the world's treasures while helping to preserve it for future generations.  4. Learn more about coral reefs.  How many different species live in reefs?  What new medicines have been discovered in reef organisms.  Participate in training or educational programmes that focus on reef ecology.  When you further your own education, you can help others understand the fragility and value of the world's coral reefs.  5.  Become a member of your local aquarium or zoo.	93.09490317061136

Coral bleaching happens when corals lose their vibrant colors and turn white.  But there’s a lot more to it than that.  Coral are bright and colorful because of microscopic algae called zooxanthellae.  The zooxanthellae live within the coral in a mutually beneficial relationship, each helping the other survive.  But when the ocean environment changes—if it gets too hot, for instance—the coral stresses out and expels the algae.  As the algae leaves, the coral fades until it looks like it’s been bleached.  If the temperature stays high, the coral won’t let the algae back, and the coral will die.  Protect Coral Reefs You can help protect coral reefs, too.  Climate change poses a fundamental threat to coral reefs.  Simple steps such as carpooling to work or using mass transit can help reduce your carbon footprint and protect these vibrant ecosystems.

WAPO_QVQ7DVUHHFCZLEONFBCD2PC2GA-2	The new survey of 100 major coral reefs, from 1980 through 2016, found only a handful that had not suffered severe bleachings during that period. More striking, it found that the rate of severe bleaching is increasing over time.   The average reef in the group bleached severely once every 25 or 30 years at the beginning of the 1980s, but by 2016 the recurrence time for severe bleaching was just 5.9 years.  The study said that as ocean waters have grown steadily warmer, global bleaching events are now triggered not only in warm water El Nino years, but potentially in any year, including cooler La Nina years.  The change has occurred during about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of overall global warming so far, highlighting the fact that corals — whose existence, based on an ancient symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, evolved millions of years ago — are a particularly sensitive system.  Eakin is one of 25 authors of the study in Science, whose contributors hail from institutions in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States.  The paper’s first author is Terry Hughes of the Australian Research Council Center for Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia.	88.42686166477506

""Three severe bleaching events in five years is not something we anticipated happening until the middle of the century.""  Climate change could kill all of Earth's coral reefs by 2100, scientists warn Warm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching, which is when corals turn white as a stress response to water that is too warm.  This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color.  Read More Bleaching doesn't kill coral immediately.  But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.  Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching.  What he saw was unprecedented.  ""For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,"" he said.  Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching."	75.1910519602825

The third bleaching occurred only five years after the second.  This means that half the world’s corals died over just 30 years.  Why corals turn white Coral bleaching is one of the consequences of global warming, i.e. the rise in the global temperatures of both air and oceans caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, CO2) released into the atmosphere by human-related activities such as the burning of petroleum and coal.  According to the documentary, 93 per cent the heat released into the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean.  Without our oceans, we’ll be doomed.  Indeed, we would be already experiencing a temperature of 50 degrees, rather than talking about a 3-degree increase in the average temperature by the end of the century.  Corals in the American Samoa© XL Catlin Seaview Survey/The Ocean Agency/Richard Vevers And the first proofs of warming oceans and ocean acidification are coral bleaching and the death of corals.

MARCO_18_438706474-27	Bikepacking Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear.  Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers.  A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack, and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit.  Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails.  Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum frame bag capacity.  This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube, and a reduced stem degree.  Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 – 120 km) in a given day as the riding can be technical.  Risks Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines like downhill biking, free ride and dirt jumping.	96.58551819395508

The Basics Given that this is our complete guide to bikepacking bags, we’ll begin with a few definitions for beginners.  Let’s first clarify the difference between bikepacking and bike touring.  Although neither are mutually exclusive — and there’s inevitably plenty of overlap — the two often diverge in the style of travel they encourage.  Traditional touring tends to be enjoyed on heavily laden bikes, and as a result, often gravitates towards paved routes and byways.  Minimal in style, modern bikepacking is based more on the exploration of off-pavement roads, backcountry trails, and singletrack.  Furthermore, the two are largely differentiated by the style of bag setup they’re associated with, and the bikes that are used.  Traditional touring uses racks and panniers; as a result, touring bikes bikes are designed for this purpose.  The beauty of bikepacking is in its simplicity: any bike can be a bikepacking bike.  Thanks to the advent of soft bags, bikepacking doesn’t depend on a particular frame having eyelets for racks and panniers.  Full-suspension, carbon, ‘cross, hardtail, fat, rigid — almost any bike will do.	92.29403543530498

My goal with this post is to help you understand how these two different systems – rack and panniers versus bikepacking bags – work, and how to approach choosing from amongst the wonderful array of options for your next pedal-powered adventure.  Panniers versus Bikepacking Bags First, a quick overview of terms.  What are racks and panniers?  Panniers are bags that attach to racks, which attach to your bike.  They come in left/right pairs, and a full setup includes four: two in back and two in the front, though many people ride with only rear panniers on lighter trips.  A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.  Racks and panniers are usually (but not always) associated with the “bicycle touring” style: longer distances or international trips, more and heavier gear, more pavement than dirt, more populated than remote, more motels and established campgrounds than wilderness camping (though this last one is more variable).	93.94209841417614

The purpose of bikepacking bags and panniers is to carry luggage on your bike.  Generally speaking, bikepacking bags are made for off-road use while panniers and racks are made for road riding.  Racks and panniers are generally preferred by bicycle tourists who need to carry all of the necessities for weeks, months, or even years on the road.  Most bicycle tourists spend more time riding on the pavement and travel long distances.  Often internationally.  Bikepacking bags are often preferred by those who spend more time riding off-pavement, on long stretches of gravel roads, and single track through rural or wilderness regions.  Most bikepackers take a minimalist approach to packing to keep the bike lightweight and agile.  What are Bikepacking Bags?  Bikepacking bags are soft bags that attach directly to the frame of the bike with straps and Velcro.  No metal racks are needed.  A wide range of bikepacking bags have hit the market to fit different sizes and styles of bikes.  You can find bikepacking bags that will fit pretty much every frame.  Many manufacturers are happy to build custom bags for you as well.	89.16862066939939
506	146_1-3	What are bike packing bags?	MARCO_06_890080970-6	Most pannier racks sit over the back wheel, attached to the bike near the rear wheel axle and rear brake bridge. Pannier bags then clip on either side.  There are options for extra bags that sit on top of the rack, or you can leave it empty and simply strap extra cargo to the top.  Some bikes also have fittings for racks either side of the front wheel which can hold bags as well.  The bags themselves have a firm back for structure with clips that securely hold onto the metal frame of the racks.  Pannier bags are water resistant or waterproof and are constructed from tough materials to protect your things in the event of a crash.  Many feature handy straps for carrying the bags by hand once you get to your destination and reflective detailing to help you stay seen in low light.  Pannier bags can carry more any cycling rucksack and there is no more comfortable way to carry a heavy load - after all, it's the bike carrying it, not you!  Using rucksack might have benefits for off-road handling, but it is not ideal for touring holidays when you are riding for longer with a heavier load.  Cycling is already tough on many people's backs; a heavy rucksack can just make things worse.	84.2280946734827

Can You Put a Pannier Rack On a Road Bike Road bikes are not much different from touring bikes, which is why the answer to this question is yes.  You can put a pannier rack on a road bike, or even a mountain bike for that matter, as long as the mounting holes are compatible.  However, you may still have follow-up questions, which is why we’re going to take a closer look at this matter.  A road bike does not have a fixed structure.  Some have eyelets, while others do not.  The length of the chainstay also differs.  Lastly, different materials can be used on the bike, resulting in different weights.  By considering these factors, you can find out how you can put a pannier rack on a road bike and which can be considered as one of the right pannier racks for road bike.  With or without eyelets – To begin with, if your road bike has eyelets, attaching a pannier rack is quite simple.  However, if there’s no eyelet, you should get racks that have clamps or brackets for the seat post.  With this component, installation is much easier but less secure.	79.5040628388524
508	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306906707-6	Can you put panniers on a road bike? You can put panniers on a road bike but you will need a special type of pannier rack to do this.  Since road bikes don’t have the mounting options on the frame (or ‘eyelets’) for adding a rack, you will need to buy a rear rack that attaches to your seat post to put panniers on your road bike.  The only downside to this is that the seat post racks generally have a lighter weight limit given the alternative mounting position.  That being said, on a bike commute you should still have no problems carrying all that you need on a road bike with panniers on a rack fitted in this way.  The same road bike as above with a rear seat-post rack.  This is an option if you want to commute on a road bike and carry panniers.  Road bikes don’t have the pannier rack option because they are designed for speed and are therefore made to be as streamlined as possible.  Adding panniers and a rack are therefore not what road bikes were originally intended for, but don’t let that stop you for your ride to work.

509	146_1-5	Can any bike be used for bike packing?	MARCO_29_1306897671-3	You would need to use bolts that come with your panniers to attach them here. Your rack can then be attached using a few simple tools like hexkey and a wrench, so there is no real need to pay someone to do it, although it would be cheap if you needed to visit your local bike store to ask for help with this.  Do pannier racks fit all bikes?  No, unfortunately not all bikes can have standard pannier racks on them, with most road bikes not being able to hold a standard pannier rack.  That said, you can still buy a special seat-post-mounted rear rack that functions in a similar way to attach to your road bike.  Although this will work for most bike commuters on road bikes, you should be careful not to overload a seat-post-mounted pannier rack since road bikes are designed for speed and are not meant to be weighted down.  It is true that their frames can handle a fair amount of weight, but having this strain on your seat post, combined with it affecting the geometry of your road bike, could make it a little difficult to control your road bike if commuting with weighty pannier bags on the back.	73.41825691796839

That said, here are some options available to choose from when selecting the best seat for your child.  Types of seats Rear facing only These are generally the bucket-style infant seats that most parents use for their newborns.  These seats often come with a base that is installed in the car that couples with a removable seat portion.  The seats can often be paired with strollers as part of a travel system.  These seats are designed to be carried outside of the car so they typically feature lower weight and height limits.  Once your baby has reached the limit for their rear-facing only seat, often that’s 35 pounds or 35 inches, they can move into a combination convertible or 3-in-1 seat with a higher weight and height limit.  Convertible Most convertible car seats can be used in the rear-facing position until a child reaches the weight limit, typically 40 to 50 pounds.  At that point, the seat can be converted into a forward-facing car seat.  These seats are larger and designed to stay installed in the vehicle.  They feature 5-point harnesses, which feature straps that have 5 contact points — both shoulders, both hips, and crotch.	90.4016682524234

MARCO_50_2240949679-177	So in conclusion, Marvel's live-action movies are generally better than DC (with the exception of the dark knight trilogy) but DC rules the animated movies. Side note: I'd very much recommend “Batman: Under the red hood” which is, in my opinion, one of the best animated movies of all time.  Personally, I love the “Son of batman” trilogy but I know not all fans feel the same way.  And lastly, the animated series “Young Justice” is great, and it's even getting a new season this year!  *Note that this is all MY opinion and I respect others' opinions* Quora User , Longtime reader, eventual translator in Brazil.

From Avengers: Endgame to Iron Man By GamesRadar Staff 5 months ago Look back on a decade of the best Marvel movies – now with added Spider-Man: Far From Home!  (Image credit: Disney/Marvel)  With over 10 years of Marvel movies, ranking them is a bit of a daunting prospect.  There's plenty of worthy contenders for the top spot, like Black Panther, Avengers: Endgame, or Infinity War, which makes picking just one almost undoable.  But, the teams at GamesRadar+ and Total Film have come together and done the impossible – we've ranked the best Marvel movies of all time.  The MCU has hopped through its fair share of genres over the years, taking us off on cosmic space adventures, journeying into Viking mythology, and plunging into Cold War-style spy stories, which means the movies on this list can be hugely different to each other – so there's loads of choice.  The good news is you can stream most of the MCU on Disney Plus now, and there's never been a better time to get caught up as new series launch on Disney Plus throughout the year, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.	81.50662502564956
521	147_1-1	What do you think is the best Marvel movie?	MARCO_41_107614308-20	Infinity War manages to be emotionally powerful and incredibly funny (often in the same scene), its scale and scope are mind-bogglingly vast, and the crossover character interactions are unexpected and fun. Perhaps, most importantly, Marvel solves its villain problem in spectacular style, with Josh Brolin’s Thanos being both the driving force of the movie and a plausible bad guy – his grand plan is clearly deranged, but there's a weird, twisted logic to it.  And without Infinity War there could be no Endgame.  1.  Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)  Here it is.  The best Marvel movie.  The Winter Soldier set a new precedent for the MCU.  The Captain America sequel is a totally different take on the universe – a ’70s Cold War thriller that doesn't put a foot wrong.  Hell, The Winter Soldier should be named one of the best Marvel movies of all time for the elevator scene alone; a moment so memorable it was homaged in Avengers: Endgame.  The movie also has far-reaching implications for the rest of the Marvel universe – such as that SHIELD reveal – and establishes the resurrected Bucky Barnes as a major piece in the puzzle for years to come.	77.45991682470776

The moment comes right at the end of Avengers: Infinity War and leads to the snap actually taking place, which changes everything.  At this point in the film, it seems like Thor has saved the day, killing Thanos just in time.  But it turns out his attack was in the wrong body part, as Thanos smartly tells him, ""You should have gone for the head,"" proving he is still alive and able to click his fingers before disappearing.  1 ""YOU COULD NOT LIVE WITH YOUR OWN FAILURE, AND WHERE DID THAT BRING YOU?

Joe and Anthony Russo's 2018 film began the culmination of the Infinity Saga leading to the events of Avengers: Endgame.  Like its sequel, the film has some of the MCU's best moments, including the God of Thunder's epic arrival on Earth during the third act battle with Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Teenage Groot (Vin Diesel).  While Captain America (Chris Evans) remains on Earth and Iron Man ( Robert Downey Jr.) travels to Titan, Thor goes on a side-trip to Nidavellir to get his hands on another powerful weapon that could kill the Mad Titan after Mjölnir's destruction in Thor: Ragnarok.  One of the Nine Realms, Nidavellir is also home of the legendary blacksmith Eitri (Peter Dinklage) who created his powerful hammer as well as Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet.	81.29995582113042

Okay, so that ending, right?  By the end of Ant-Man and the Wasp, everything's been patched up in the Ant-Man universe.  The bad guys either turned into good guys through the power of love or were tied up and left for the cops.  Our two young heroes kissed, and our two old (er) heroes got their happy reunion.  And then, bang.  Like a punch to the face, the mid-credits scene came along to remind us that this happy little Ant-Man universe actually exists within the big, mean MCU, where Thanos beat the Avengers and dusted half the universe.  Hank, Janet, and Hope are now on the list of finger-snap casualties, and Scott's stuck in quantum-ville.  If you haven't seen Infinity War, that moment came out of nowhere, with no explanation and no follow-up.

525	147_1-5	I found the “Avengers Assemble” scene in Endgame more powerful than the elevator scene in Winter Soldier	MARCO_35_1404927520-5	Avengers: A Key Endgame Scene Was Originally in Infinity War The hammer is imbued with the power of Thor, and we saw Captain America become superpowered enough to both fight and take hits from Thanos. It can summon the clouds themselves and charge insane lightning bolts toward its enemies, with beings like Iron Man being completely incapacitated with a single attack.  Unfortunately, Hela destroyed it in short order, and we’ve seen powerful beings be able to parry its offense.  But if you apply the worthy clause, no one should be able to lift it at all in a fight.  4 Thanos’ Double-edged Sword This sword went unnamed in Avengers: Endgame, but it’s a shame we didn’t get to find out more about its properties, because the sword was incredibly powerful.  Thanos wielded it with a winning streak of almost a 100-percent, until Scarlet Witch was able to beat him.

This movie takes place at the same time as Infinity War.  And while I really feel that watching Infinity War and Endgame back-to-back is most powerful, the end-credits scene could be a major spoiler.  It’s also important to Endgame to know where Ant-Man is, so I have to place it in this order for maximum effect.  22.  Avengers: Endgame After Infinity War’s devastating events, the remaining Avengers must find a way to go on.  This movie truly ties in everything we’ve been building towards from the beginning of Phase One, and every piece just seems to finally fall into place.  23.  Spider-Man: Far From Home Following the events of Endgame, Peter is dealing with grief, but just wants a break from his heroic duties to enjoy his school trip to Italy.  Unfortunately for him though, Nick Fury needs him for a mission.  Amidst his crime-fighting, a new hero, Mysterio, shows up to help.

I loved Captain America being worthy and fighting off Thanos I loved Peter Parker’s reunite with Tony Stark I loved Captain America saying Avengers Assemble, and the portal scene I loved Tony Stark outsmarting Thanos, and becoming the first mortal to use the Infinity Stones.  I think this movie is really good, I really do.  But this movie isn’t flawless, it’s not perfect.  I don’t think RDJ deserves an Oscar nomination, I don’t think this movie is as good as Shawshank redemption, or Inception.  There are too many flaws, and I prefer the original Avenger movie than this.  The 2012 Avengers had less characters to juggle with, better pacing, and better humor.  I wanted to like this movie, and make it a 9 out of 10 like most people.  But to me, there are so many factors that bring this movie down.  The more I watch it, the more flaws I found.  In conclusion, what disappointed me in Endgame was: Humor, life-less filter, off-screen development, and first two hours.

Should he see it fit, Kang is going to possess the ability to go back to some of the biggest events that have taken place in the MCU and completely mix things up as long as it fits and ties into his version of the future.  This means that there could be some huge repercussions for what has gone down in the MCU if Earth’s Mightiest Heroes are not up to task.  While we cannot imagine a ton of retconning going on in the franchise, it is still possible that Kang will be able to make some alterations that the MCU could ultimately stick with moving forward.  Time travel is not the easiest thing to bring to the table, and there were plenty of people that poked some holes in the scenario that was brought up in Avengers: Endgame.  Nevertheless bringing in Kang the Conqueror means that everything is on the table in regard to mixing things up on the timeline.

Related: Avengers: Endgame's Ending & Marvel Movie Future Explained In Detail Indeed, while Peter Parker's return to Midtown High and reuniting with Ned is played as happy, this ignores that surely half of his class are now college age.  This poses some major implications for Spider-Man: Far From Home - it surely must be a prequel set before Avengers: Endgame, otherwise the film will have to take place in a near-miss-dystopia 2023.  It's further notable that 2020's MCU releases - Black Widow and The Eternals - are both prequels to the rest of the MCU, meaning the effects of the Infinity War don't need to be explored directly.  Time Travel's Future In The MCU After Avengers: Endgame With Hank Pym returned, there's an unlimited amount of Pym particles, meaning the Avengers are technically able to travel into the Quantum Realm as much as they so wish.  But is that something to actually expect in the MCU's future?  The plot device was rather specific to Avengers: Endgame and an opportunity to revisit previous movies in a send-off Captain America and Iron Man, so it's unlikely to be immediately returned to in future Avengers movies.	78.52255121106282

MARCO_50_2240949679-3	Iron Man, Thor, Captain America 1, Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and Black Panther are all great origin stories for each of the main hero where each character learns to grow and all feel different from one another with Captain America 1 taking up back to the 40s filled with great action, Doctor Strange introducing us to the multiverse and mystic arts with inspiring visuals, Black Panther taking us to Africa and telling a story about kingship, Ant-Man being a suspenseful heist movie about family, Thor being a coming of age story and taking us to a whole new world and Iron Man starting the MCU with some high stakes. All 4 Avengers movies have great characters, stories, character interactions, visuals and some of the best action in the MCU.  Iron Man 2 and 3 develop Tony’s character really well and have decent action within, WS + Civil War create a more ambitious political character driven plot with tons of heart and great team ups and action and Guardians 1 and 2 just take everything I want in a great movie and combine it all beautifully (aside from a great villain in Guardians 1 and maybe too much humor).

541	147_2-1	What is Marvel Studios’ approach to diversity for people of color?	WAPO_NHSQOFLA7JB5LAS5LWDWOBWILU-1	This column discusses the plot of “Captain Marvel” in general terms.   “Captain Marvel” is the “Lean In” of superhero movies, an anodyne girl-power story that treats one woman’s journey of self-discovery as a proxy for galaxy-level change.  Though the film is precisely engineered to appeal to critics like me — feminist women who came of age in the 1990s — it’s a disappointment, from the poorly shot action sequences to a shallowly written hero’s journey.  More than anything else, “Captain Marvel” is the perfect caution that giving women and people of color top billing in major franchise movies is no guarantee that those films will say anything interesting, much less daring.  In fact, the very scale at which these franchises need to appeal to audiences and the nature of their corporate entanglements suggests that these sorts of movies may be a trap for people who are eager to see not merely new faces, but new ideas of heroism, on-screen.  Our titular heroine (Brie Larson) is first introduced in 1995 as Vers, a member of the elite — literally blue-blooded — race of Kree warriors.	88.14414901994041

It was emotionally moving.  That was big one.”  The upcoming Marvel film is a big deal for a lot of people, as it continues Black Panther's tradition of being one of the pioneering people of color to ever headline his own comic book run, and now his own film.  Not only do the Black Panther trailers suggest the film is visually stunning, its cast is full of brilliant actors of color, further ensuring that Wakanda will come off as being a believable South African country, despite being a fictional one.  Plus, with Coogler at the helm, it is safe to assume that the film will be a more accurate representation of African culture - something that a lot of movies and TV shows have botched over the years.  As for the reveal that there will be a conversation between T'Challa and his late father, T'Chaka, it will be interesting to see where this particular sequence factors in the movie.  It could be a flashback or it could also be in a vision, as Black Panther looks to delve into mysticism, as much as it will tackle science and technology.	87.48532228538079

Micheline rejected the idea that diversity could be blamed for poor sales and urged the comic-book industry to expand its audience. “I can promise you that it’s not women going into comic-book shops, sick of female characters,” Micheline wrote.  “I can similarly promise you that people of color are not entering comic-book shops and turning their noses up at faces that look like theirs.  By even making remarks like these, Marvel is seemingly conceding that its target audience, its ‘core’ audience — and their ‘core’ characters — are white and male.”  Little wonder that Marvel Studios, a Disney subsidiary that owns such lucrative franchises as “The Avengers,” “Ant-Man” and “Guardians of the Galaxy,” has been slower to reflect diverse characters on the big screen.  A popular graphic put together in 2015 by Twitter users @fauxparse and @comikazejeff pointed out that, “more often, Marvel heroes are played by white dudes named Chris than all women put together.”  The graphic above is two years old now, but even updating for newer Marvel releases like “Captain America: Civil War,” “Doctor Strange” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.	88.27452397331945

Despite an increasing number of minority supporting actors in Marvel films, the main men — and women — remain almost exclusively white, Brown said.  “Captain America?  White.  Bruce Banner?  White.  The Avengers?

MARCO_35_1346382367-4	"Shuri’s adventures could help expand the world of Wakanda on-screen, while her attachment to T'Challa would add a compelling family dynamic. Hollywood loves family drama in movies anyway, so why not add some brother-sister angst to the Marvel milieu?  8 Gamora People would likely be surprised if Gamora, the assassin from 2014’s "" Guardians of the Galaxy ,"" got her own film, but she wouldn’t be a completely unexpected choice.  She’s already being played by Zoe Saldana of "" Avatar "" and "" Star Trek "" fame.  It’s not hard to imagine that Marvel might leverage her name recognition for a Gamora movie.  Then again, Guardians members Groot and Rocket Racoon are more popular because of their all-ages appeal, so they’d probably get kid-friendly animated films or tie-ins before Gamora would get anything of her own.  Regardless, if Saldana starred in her own Gamora movie, it would open up an interesting corner of Marvel’s cosmic universe.  A seasoned killer who is willing to take things farther than most other heroes, Gamora is a darker character than Captain Marvel, so her movie’s plot would possibly be edgier.  At the same time, they are both galactic heavyweights, and Gamora would bring a different presence to her cinematic adventures."	86.92208480957197

This trend is long overdue and one that is certain to continue in Phase 4 and beyond.  4 Female superheroes will be more prominent than ever Another area in which the MCU has been severely lacking so far is overall representation of female superheroes.  Though Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow has been a staple in the MCU since her character's introduction in Iron Man 2 (and has appeared in four films since), the only other female heroes through the first ten films were Jaime Alexander's Sif and Zoe Saldana's Gamora.

MARCO_51_58815921-2	Grow Your Tech Network Every recruiter needs a good business network to pull candidates from, but as you begin to narrow your focus to specific industries, your network needs to get more focused as well. In order to find more technical candidates, get referrals from existing contacts in technical industries.  Ask them what conferences they are attending, then maybe attend a few yourself.  Visit local colleges that train in technical fields to find fresh talent, and look for trade organizations for technical professionals.  Take all the advice for growing your network and apply it to technical industries.  Research Your Industries Because technical positions can be, well, technical, itâ€™s important for a technical recruiter to have a thorough knowledge of the various positions they will be sourcing candidates for.  While some of this knowledge can be gained through experience, recruiters that are looking to focus in technology recruiting should learn as much as they can about the pay structures, job titles and common management structures used in these industries as quickly as possible.  To find out about these sort of things, recruiters can talk to their technical candidates as well as their clients.  Find Talent on the Web Many technical candidates network with each other using the Internet, so a recruiter who wants to source technical talent needs to go where the candidates are.	87.31684299663175

MARCO_19_1519183645-2	Having a degree, doing an apprenticeship or just simply carrying out work experience could all give you a way into the tech and engineering industries. If you’re just starting out in your career, why not consider studying a technology or engineering related subject at University, such as Computer Science?  Or, alternatively, study at college whilst working as an apprentice at a local company?  Remember, breaking into the tech and engineering industries isn’t only possible for young people at the beginning of their careers.  Those who are looking to change career could consider studying at evening or weekend classes, or, if it is financially feasible, work part-time whilst studying, 2) Get to know the sector Both the tech and engineering industries are incredibly vast, so in order to narrow down your options it’s worthwhile gaining experience in a few roles.  This will give you direction when job hunting, and give you the opportunity to find local companies that will allow you to shadow them; perhaps you have a family friend that works in tech?

573	148_2-5	What should I do next after getting an interview with a tech company?	MARCO_43_1678693339-7	Your time with each interviewer is limited so be mindful of rambling. Practicing your answers beforehand can help keep you focused. 19.  Do not speak negatively about your previous employers.  Companies want to hire problem solvers who overcome tough situations.  If you’re feeling discouraged about your current job, focus on talking about what you’ve gained from that experience and what you want to do next.  Tips for after the interview When the interview is over, give yourself the best chances of moving forward by doing the following: 20.  Ask about next steps.  After your interview, it is appropriate to ask either your interviewer, hiring manager or recruiter about what you should expect next.  This will likely be a follow-up email with results from your interview, additional requirements like an assignment or reference list or another interview.  21.  Send a personalized thank you letter after the interview.  Ask for the business card of each person you speak with during the interview process so that you can follow up individually with a separate thank you email.  If you interviewed in the morning, send your follow-up emails the same day.  If you interviewed in the afternoon, the next morning is fine.  Make certain that each email is distinct from the others, using the notes you took during the conversations.	77.86712727393024

(Some might be phone, Skype, or Zoom, and others may be in person.)  If the company reaches out to you asking you to do a video interview, confirm what type of video conferencing software or app they prefer to use, schedule your interview for a time you know you will have seamless internet, and make sure that you will have access to a private location.  Do a test run of the video chat program ahead of time, if you don’t use it often.  After the first interview, they’ll usually let you know what to expect next.  If the first interview is over the phone, they’ll likely want you to do a second interview in person.  If you met in person the first time, they should inform you of what will come next, either another meeting or a decision.  Average Amount of Time to Get a Job Offer The amount of time from interview to job offer varies.

575	148_2-5	What should I do next after getting an interview with a tech company?	MARCO_13_1503049432-11	So what you should be doing after you get home from an interview is: Deciding if you are interested in the position so can respond appropriately when they give feedback Tracking the dates of your past interviews so you know when to follow-up if you’ve heard no response Applying for more jobs! Never count on one single opportunity to work out, and keep applying for positions until you’ve accepted a job offer… You could do everything right in the interview and still not get the job.  There’s a lot of luck involved in job searching.  So counting on one single job offer is dangerous and could set you back weeks if it turns out you get rejected after the interview.  So even though it’s tempting to wait and hope for good news, keep applying for positions and setting up interviews.  What To Do Next: No matter how you think your interview went, the best thing you can do is keep job searching.  Keep applying for jobs.  Keep your momentum going.  The biggest mistake I see job seekers make is they get 1 or 2 interviews and stop applying for jobs, and they just hope those first couple of interviews will turn into job offers.  Don’t gamble.  Keep applying.	73.71528604999185

Author Gerald Murphy Date published February 17, 2016 Categories Analytics SEO In a recent article right here on SEW, Christopher investigated the manipulation of UK political party autosuggest queries, but what exactly is search engine bias?  Search engine bias is the unfair skewing of results and it sits within the intermediary mechanism of search systems (see diagram below) and biases can be split into three parts: 1) Non-neutral search engine technology Years ago studies focused exclusively on search software.  Soon people realised that the user interface is of equal importance to any algorithm, as this is the view we get of the system and our successful use of it.  Now, this is where it gets even more interesting, the presentation of results influences free-thought which powers interaction.  As a result, all search engines are bias because of the design and user interface.  We have two types of result inspection bias: quality and trust.	83.94157460238785

Google Liberal Bias: Does It Exist?  63% of Results are Non-Partisan While 63% is almost a failing score in school, it’s impressive that an algorithm can be so effective.  316 of the results were from non-partisan and unbiased websites.

579	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_50_796224832-19	Index size A large index size ensures that (ideally) all content available on the web can be searched and found. A search engine could bias the search results by not or not fully indexing some sites.  Ranking A good ranking ensures that from the billions of pages indexed you receive the most relevant results regarding to your query.  A search engine could bias the search results either by completely filtering the search results from specific sites or by giving it a lower ranking, for all or for specific queries, and thus burying as rarely somebody looks beyond the first two or three results pages.  Auto complete / suggestion / query rewriting Search engines assist the user in completing and refining their search queries, which ultimately influences the search results which are returned to the user.  A search engine could bias the search results by blocking certain suggestions or by proposing different suggestions.  Political preference of search engines companies and search engine employees Whether and to which extent specific search engine results are politically biased is not known, but there are data available about the political preference of companies and employees.

581	149_1-3	In what ways can search engines be biased?	MARCO_52_258700460-2	Quality bias means that the searcher will subconsciously take into account surrounding results and if they’re not relevant our behaviour can change, we may decide to retype our query or inspect a site we otherwise would not have dreamt of. This is precisely the reason why engines have quality scores for their paid search systems, if paid results are irrelevant this can mess with organic result inspection.  For the most part search algorithms are generally very effective at presenting us with relevant results so we trust the engine, this is known as trust bias.  Personalisation through cookies and the creation of 3D cubes are used to increase relevancy.  While there are many advantages of personalisation, personalisation restricts results and is a form of search engine bias.  2) Result manipulation Political and social bias came to the fore in 2002 when Google was temporarily blocked in China and since then, with the USA’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act, indexes and results have always been filtered to comply a little better with the law.  Let’s now take this the other way around, is search engine coverage biased along national lines?  In short, yes.  Engines do not have proportional coverage of a particular group of websites or regions.  But why is this?

585	149_3-1	How do you get impartial results from search engines?	KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.  And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.   Search neutrality became a concern after search engines, most notably Google, were accused of search bias by other companies.  Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.   The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.  Sites like Amazon.com and Facebook are also accused of skewing results."	91.68614597272244

The search engine market is very one sided with just a couple companies controlling the entire market.  “ Search neutrality is a principle that search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.  This means that when a user queries a search engine, the engine should return the most relevant results found in the provider’s domain (those sites which the engine has knowledge of), without manipulating the order of the results (except to rank them by relevance), excluding results, or in any other way manipulating the results to a certain bias .”  -Wikipedia  According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.	95.93462355261
590	149_3-3	Um, what is search neutrality?	KILT_25606638-3	"Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other information retrieval applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking).  ""Relevance"" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results.  Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences.  And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.   Search neutrality became a concern after search engines, most notably Google, were accused of search bias by other companies.  Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.   The call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.  Sites like Amazon.com and Facebook are also accused of skewing results."	92.14953753013832

MARCO_46_88404462-1	"6 Ways To Get Unfiltered Google Search Results Home Internet 6 Ways To Get Unfiltered Google Search Results By Robert Irvine Published Nov 21, 2020 Share Share Tweet Email Escape Google's filter bubble, and use these methods to depersonalize your Google search results.  Google uses the information it collects about you to make your search results more accurate and relevant.  But by shaping the content you see to match your perceived interests, it also places you in a “filter bubble.""  This means you may miss out on useful sites that Google's algorithms deem less suitable for you.  Depersonalizing your results, whether temporarily or permanently, lets you break free from Google’s influence without ditching the search engine altogether.  We’ll explain how to burst your filter bubble to enjoy an unbiased search experience.  1.  Search Anonymously in Private Browsing Mode The easiest way to get unfiltered search results is to use your browser’s private mode.  In theory, this lets you search the web without being logged into your Google account.  This way, your previous search activity doesn’t influence the results.  To switch to private mode, click the menu button in the top-right corner of your browser and choose New incognito window (in Chrome), New Private Window (in Firefox), or New InPrivate window (in Edge)."	86.11219388875179

MARCO_50_2268879788-4	By my observation that’s not true at all (else I would not be here at this question hoping to find names of unbiased search engines). There are major search engine companies who intentionally steer users toward their ideology—more accurately they intentionally steer away from ideologies they don’t espouse and away from data and opinion that’s inconvenient to their own preferred narrative.  Some of them have been caught on camera boasting about it and waxing eloquent on their intention to use their platform to influence elections toward what they themselves prefer.  A lot of people don’t appreciate such attitudes at all, including myself.  (Those who don’t notice are simply the ones who like the skewed narrative they’re hearing—they know it’s skewed but they like it that way.)  Personally I have a lot of trouble finding unbiased accounts of events on some of these search platforms.  I have to overtly include the name of publications I trust or else the “other side of the story” won’t come up until forty or more search results down the list, if at all.  The reality for these platforms is not unintentional bias—it’s overt, painfully transparent and intentional bias masquerading as impartiality and using the claim of “unintentional bias” as a fallback excuse in case they are taken to task.	82.69766137539409

603	149_2-5	Are algorithms really biased against people of colour	MARCO_32_288536633-3	Late last year, the federal government released its own damning report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly. The federal government study concluded the rates of error tended to be highest for Black women, just as Buolamwini, Gebru, and Raji found.  These error-prone, racially biased algorithms can have devastating impacts for people of color.  For example, many police departments use face recognition technology to identify suspects and make arrests.  One false match can lead to a wrongful arrest, a lengthy detention, and even deadly police violence.  Second, police in many jurisdictions in the U.S. use mugshot databases to identify people with face recognition algorithms.  But using mugshot databases for face recognition recycles racial bias from the past, supercharging that bias with 21st century surveillance technology.  Across the U.S., Black people face arrest for a variety of crimes at far higher rates than white people.  Take cannabis arrests, for just one example.  Cannabis use rates are about the same for white and Black people, but Black people are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.	88.49469550419599

The book argues that algorithms perpetuate oppression and discriminate against People of Color, specifically women of color.  Noble takes a Black intersectional feminist approach to her work in studying how google algorithms affect people differently by race and gender.  Intersectional Feminism takes into account the diverse experiences of women of different races and sexualities when discussing their oppression society, and how their distinct backgrounds affect their struggles.  Additionally, Noble’s argument addresses how racism infiltrates the google algorithm itself, something that is true throughout many coding systems including facial recognition, and medical care programs.

Johnson reports. The findings highlight the ubiquity of racial biases in the algorithms that help shape even the most critical areas of our lives.  While the study focused on just one tool from a company called Optum, bias probably exists in tools across the private and public sectors that help manage the health care of more than 200 million Americans, researchers reported in the journal Science.  “It’s truly inconceivable to me that anyone else’s algorithm doesn’t suffer from this,” said Sendhil Mullainathan, a professor of computation and behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who oversaw the research.  “I’m hopeful that this causes the entire industry to say, ‘Oh, my, we’ve got to fix this.’ ”  Optum is working on a fix that could more than double the number of black patients the algorithm can identify, but it’s hard to say how many algorithms for medical care have similar issues since their inner workings are often shielded from researchers.  Some lawmakers have even introduced legislation to force companies to take accountability for such biases — intentional or not.	75.9766687694937

They are designed to eliminate “unsuitable” resumes before they ever get seen by a hiring manager.  Whether an applicant's resume is perceived as a good fit is initially determined by a ""bot,"" not a person.  Employers programs the software to screen for certain skills and attributes reflected in keywords and phrases.  The ATS scans resumes on that basis, then, scores and ranks them based on how many keywords and phrases appear (as well as other factors).  Your resume will only make the cut if it is in the top ranking range.  That means it is vital for you to use those keywords in your high school resume.  Also pay special attention to formal requirements indicated in the job listing such as city, contact information, age, etc.  Now you may be wondering, how do I fit those skill keywords in with no experience?

The use of Applicant Tracking Systems has increased dramatically in the last few years: as shown in the image above, over 95% of large companies and over 50% of mid-sized companies use an ATS.  So what does the ATS look for in your resume?  The ATS algorithm scans for keywords that are related to the advertised job.  It also scans for information related to your work experience and education.  If the ATS determines that your resume is a good match for the position, it gives you a high ranking.  This ranking improves your chances of being seen by a recruiter and ultimately landing the interview.  Here is a popular ATS resume analyzer called Taleo, which demonstrates how an employer sees candidates for a particular job opening: As you can see, the ATS judges the candidates to the best-matched position and are given a higher ranking.  Why is it so important to optimize your resume for an ATS?  Your resume is up against a lot, so optimizing your resume for ATS scans will give you the best chance of getting noticed by an employer.

Subsequently, it will scan for specific keywords and phrases.  Where do these keywords come from?  Yep, you guessed it right.  The job description.  Like we earlier stated, almost all the words in a JD can be construed as keywords that can be used by an HR to screen and shortlist candidates.  The ATS will break down your resume into individual categories: Education, Contact Information, Skills and Work Experience.  The desired skills and keywords are then matched against your resume to determine your potential value to the organization.  Resumes with the highest scores relevant to the specified keywords/phrases will be moved up for further review.  Now you know how it broadly works.
