# Data

This folder should contain the description of data that was used in the project, including datasets, queries, ground truth, run files, etc.  Files under 10MB can be stored on GitHub, larger files should be stored on a server (e.g., gustav1).  This README should provide a comprehensive overview of all the data that is used and where it originates from (e.g., part of an official test collection, generated using code in this repo or a third-party tool, etc.).
