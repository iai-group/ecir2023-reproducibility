Once the growing season ends, shorter, milder winters fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons.  In some ecosystems, maximum daily temperatures might climb beyond the tolerance of indigenous plant or animal.  To survive the extreme temperatures, both marine and land-based plants and animals have started to migrate towards the poles.  Those species, and in some cases, entire ecosystems, that cannot quickly migrate or adapt, face extinction.  The IPCC estimates that 20-30 percent of plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction if temperatures climb more than 1.5\u00b0 to 2.5\u00b0C.  Impacting People The changes to weather and ecosystems will also affect people more directly.  Hardest hit will be those living in low-lying coastal areas, and residents of poorer countries who do not have the resources to adapt to changes in temperature extremes and water resources.  As tropical temperature zones expand, the reach of some infectious diseases, such as malaria, will change.

Extreme heat can \u201c overpower the human body \u201d and cause dehydration, heatstroke, and major organ damage.  And certain populations are more at risk from the impacts of heatwaves than others, including the elderly, children, and the poor.  Air quality: Pollution from burning fossil fuels is bad enough for the air we breathe, but many impacts of climate change also impact air quality.  For instance, climate change has been linked to more wildfires.  Wildfire smoke carries fine particles that \u201c can penetrate deep into your lungs .\u201d  Exposure has been linked to burning eyes, heart and lung diseases, and even death.  Vector-borne diseases: Vector-borne diseases are illnesses spread by insects or arachnids like mosquitoes, fleas, mites, and ticks.

To be precise, Prof Tol calculated that climate change would be beneficial up to 2.2\u02daC of warming from 2009 (when he wrote his paper).  This means approximately 3\u02daC from pre-industrial levels, since about 0.8\u02daC of warming has happened in the last 150 years.  The latest estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that such temperatures may not be reached till the end of the century \u2014\u00a0if at all.

Realizing that greenhouse emissions remain in the atmosphere for a very long time, this principle recognizes that historically: Industrialized nations have emitted far more greenhouse gas emissions (even if some developing nations are only now increasing theirs); Rich countries therefore face the biggest responsibility and burden for action to address climate change; and Rich countries therefore must support developing nations adapt\u2014through financing and technology transfer, for example.  This notion of climate justice is typically ignored by many rich nations and their mainstream media, making it easy to blame China, India and other developing countries for failures in climate change mitigation negotiations.  Development expert, Martin Khor, calculated that taking historical emissions into account, the rich countries owe a carbon debt because they have already used more than their fair quota of emissions."

This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world\u2019s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

But on the other hand, the people who were aware of climate change in developing nations perceived its risk to be higher than those in developed nations.  Leiserowitz adds that many people in developing nations who had never been educated about climate change said they had nonetheless already noticed local changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.  This is not necessarily surprising \u2014 time and again, scientists have warned that developing nations are likely to be hit hardest by the effects of climate change, and many climate-related changes in temperature and weather patterns are already most apparent in these places.  It\u2019s a disproportional and, in many activists\u2019 opinion, unjust aspect of climate change: The nations that have contributed the least amount of carbon emissions to Earth\u2019s atmosphere are suffering the worst effects.

Public finance is especially vital for activities where it is difficult to attract private investment, such as adaptation, which has historically lagged behind mitigation in terms of funding.  While the Agreement fell short of quantifying adaptation finance goals , countries agreed to balance overall public climate finance flows between adaptation and mitigation.  Developed countries also committed to significantly increase support for adaptation before 2020.

The COP26 event is a global united Nations summit about climate change and how countries are planning to tackle it.  It was due to take place in Glasgow from 9 - 19 November with more than 200 world leaders due to attend, but when coronavirus arrived, that all changed.  Cop26 was moved to 1 and 12 November 2021 but many young activists from around the world are meeting at an online conference called Mock COP26 on the original dates.  So what is COP26 all about?

Back to Top Factors Greenhouse Gases The increase in greenhouse gases caused by human activity is often cited as one of the major causes of global warming.  These greenhouse gases reabsorb heat reflected from the Earth's surface, thus trapping the heat in our atmosphere.  This natural process is essential for life on Earth because it plays an important role in regulating the Earth's temperature.  However, over the last several hundred years, humans have been artificially increasing the concentration of these gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane in the Earth's atmosphere.  These gases build up and prevent additional thermal radiation from leaving the Earth, thereby trapping excess heat."

                    "Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change (and are therefore called \"highly climate vulnerable\") due to their relatively low levels of wealth, technology, education, infrastructure and access to resources. This applies to many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa or Small Island Developing States.  Some of those island states are likely to face total inundation.  Fragile states or failed states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, and Somalia are among the worst affected.   Climate vulnerability has been quantified in the Climate Vulnerability Monitor reports of 2010 and 2012.  Climate vulnerability in developing countries occurs in four impact areas: health, extreme weather, habitat loss, and economic stress.  A report by the Climate Vulnerability Monitor in 2012 estimated that climate change causes 400,000 deaths on average each year, mainly due to hunger and communicable diseases in developing countries.  These effects are most severe for the world\u2019s poorest countries.   A changing climate also results in economic burdens.  The economies in Least Developed Countries have lost an average of 7% of their gross domestic product for the year 2010, mainly due to reduced labor productivity.

But on the other hand, the people who were aware of climate change in developing nations perceived its risk to be higher than those in developed nations.  Leiserowitz adds that many people in developing nations who had never been educated about climate change said they had nonetheless already noticed local changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.  This is not necessarily surprising \u2014 time and again, scientists have warned that developing nations are likely to be hit hardest by the effects of climate change, and many climate-related changes in temperature and weather patterns are already most apparent in these places.  It\u2019s a disproportional and, in many activists\u2019 opinion, unjust aspect of climate change: The nations that have contributed the least amount of carbon emissions to Earth\u2019s atmosphere are suffering the worst effects.  And the new study\u2019s results highlight another aspect of this climate injustice \u2014 that is, people in the nations likely to be most affected by climate change are the least educated on the issue and therefore the least prepared for its effects.  \u201cNot knowing you\u2019re at risk makes you more vulnerable to risk,\u201d Leiserowitz says."

A number of developing countries have already elected to contribute climate finance, with nine making contributions to the Green Climate Fund.  The Agreement recognizes this and encourages other countries to join in.  Already, Brazil\u2019s President Dilma Rousseff said the country is considering contributing climate finance, joining other emerging economies like China, which pledged to provide $3.1 billion over three years.  Public finance is especially vital for activities where it is difficult to attract private investment, such as adaptation, which has historically lagged behind mitigation in terms of funding.  While the Agreement fell short of quantifying adaptation finance goals , countries agreed to balance overall public climate finance flows between adaptation and mitigation.  Developed countries also committed to significantly increase support for adaptation before 2020.  Lastly, countries agreed that the Adaptation Fund, created under the Kyoto Protocol, could play a role in implementing the Paris Agreement."

It is important for all governments and stakeholders to understand and assess the financial needs of developing countries, as well as to understand how these financial resources can be mobilized.  Provision of resources should also aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation.

Assessing progress in provision and mobilization of support is also part of the global stocktake under the Agreement.  The Paris Agreement also places emphasis on the transparency and enhanced predictability of financial support.  What is the financial mechanism?  What are the other funds?

In this regard, we are already making strong progress towards meeting the existing goal to mobilize $100 billion from a wide variety of sources, including both public and private, by 2020.  The Paris outcome provides further confidence that this goal will be met and that climate finance will continue to flow.  For the first time, the Agreement recognizes the reality that countries like China are already joining the base of donor countries contributing to climate finance and encourages developing countries to contribute to climate finance, while reaffirming that the United States and other developed economies should continue to take the lead.

                    "How to Make Scented Body Lotion - ModernMom How to Make Scented Body Lotion October 11, 2016 by ModernMom Staff Leave a Comment Scented body lotion can be expensive and may contain irritants or allergens.  You can easily make your own scented lotions, either to use yourself or give as gifts.  It is easy to customize homemade scented body lotion to your specific needs, whether you prefer something light or a heavy moisturizer.  Reuse lotion bottles you already have or buy attractive containers to hold your scented body lotion and make a pretty bathroom display.  Choose the fragrances you love and the lotions that work best for your skin when you make your own scented body lotion.  Step 1 Purchase an unscented lotion base.  You can buy lotion bases from soap making suppliers or simply opt for a bottle of unscented lotion from your local discount or department store.  Choose a lotion that will work well with your skin chemistry, whether you need a very light lotion or a heavier moisturizer.  You may want to make scented body lotion in a heavier formulation for winter and a lighter one for summer, or make several in different scents.  Step 2 Choose fragrance or essential oils.  Essential oils are extracted from plants and can be less potentially irritating or allergenic.",
                    "You can also buy a wide variety of fragrance oils, ranging from oils made to use as perfumes to oils made for scenting toiletries. Be sure that the fragrance oil you choose is made for use on the skin as opposed to as a room fragrance.  Avoid alcohol- or water-based perfumes when you intend to use the fragrance to make a scented lotion.  Step 3 Make sure that your containers are clean.  If you are using a commercial lotion, the preservatives in the lotion will prevent bacterial growth, so sterilization is not required.  You can reuse containers you already have, use the original lotion container or purchase lotion bottles of various sorts.  Wash out your containers well with hot soapy water and dry thoroughly.

A single application of milk cream gets absorbed into the skin quickly and keeps it nourishes for a longer period of time.

If you know what features you want you can get a phone with all the latest features and functionalities if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.

It will prevent you from buying a more expensive phone which has lots of features that you don\u2019t want.  Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.

                    "Other tips and tricks you should know There are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when buying a new phone. First of all, don\u2019t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you\u2019re used to.  Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.  Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn\u2019t mean it makes bad phones.  As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don\u2019t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it\u2019s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don\u2019t just go for the latest phones out there.  Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model.  A lot of the time the latest versions of phones are only minor upgrades over their predecessors but cost a lot more."

I saw about 10 other runners during my morning run with every person, but two, running with their phones in their hands or strapped to their arms.  I prefer to run with my phone for a couple of reasons; I enjoy capturing photos on my routes since I often run when I travel around the world and I want a means to call my wife or 911 in case of an emergency.  In my experiences, many recreational runners tend to run with their phones so I better understand Apple's move to not put in a GPS receiver.  Given the solid performance of the Apple Workout app without GPS, I have no problem leaving the phone behind every now and then.  The only thing missing is the map data.

If you know what features you want you can get a phone with all the latest features and functionalities if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.  Or if you\u2019re looking for a basic cell phone knowing what features you want ahead of time will help you to avoid spending too much money.  It will prevent you from buying a more expensive phone which has lots of features that you don\u2019t want.  Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.  It would be better for you to get a smaller phone.  Display Screen: OnePlus 7 LCD The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen on cell phones has gotten better over the years.",
                    "Other tips and tricks you should know There are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when buying a new phone. First of all, don\u2019t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you\u2019re used to.  Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.  Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn\u2019t mean it makes bad phones.  As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don\u2019t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it\u2019s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don\u2019t just go for the latest phones out there.  Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model.  A lot of the time the latest versions of phones are only minor upgrades over their predecessors but cost a lot more."

                    "Though it doesn't shoot 4K video and I'm not a huge fan of Samsung's One UI, the A50's superior camera, sleeker design and longer battery life make it the better phone. Samsung's Galaxy A50 serves up a Galaxy experience for much less See all photos +10 More Galaxy A50 looks better, but has no water protection Though both phones are similar in size and design, there are a few details that elevate the Galaxy A50 above the Moto G7.  For instance, the Moto G7 has a larger camera bump on the back.  Having a bump isn't a deal breaker, and a lot of phones have it including the iPhone.  The Galaxy A50's camera is way more flushed, it looks flatter and sleeker.  The on-screen camera notch for the front-facing camera is also smaller, so it's less obtrusive when you're viewing the display.  Lastly, because the Galaxy A50 has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, the device looks more seamless overall.  The Moto G7, on the other hand, has a visible reader on the back that's emblazoned with the Motorola logo (and there's a Motorola logo on the front too, on the bottom bezel), which isn't as appealing.",
                    "In addition, the Galaxy A50 has an AMOLED display compared to the Moto G7's LCD screen. Though both phones have about the same resolution and pixel density, the Galaxy A50 screen is brighter and colors are much more vibrant.  Blacks are much darker and inkier as well.  When viewing both phones at different angles, the color shift is more severe on the Moto G7 too.  That means colors wash out dramatically and the screen appears to get dimmer at certain angles.  One advantage the Moto G7 does have is that it's slightly water repellent.  You can't fully submerge it underwater, but it does have a nano-coating that protects it against light water sprinkles and splashes.  Samsung did not add water protection to the A50.  The camera bump on the A50 is less prominent.  Angela Lang/CNET Don't care about 4K video?  Galaxy A50's camera is superior Both the Galaxy A50 and Moto G7 take clear and bright photos when conditions are ideal, as in settings with a lot of even lighting.  And while the Galaxy A50 can record only 1080p video (compared to the Moto G7's 4K maximum), the Galaxy A50's camera still pulls ahead of the Moto G7 in many ways.",

Lynn La/CNET Both phones pulled off the bokeh effect for portraits comparably and the fallouts between the fore and backgrounds were smooth and natural-looking.  You can also take portraits with the front-facing camera on both phones.  When I took a selfie, both phones showed some patchiness around my hair.  However, I still prefer the Galaxy A50's picture because the white balance was more accurate.  Unlike the Moto G7 though, the A50 cannot shoot 4K video.  Instead, it shoots 1080p video, and videos in that resolution were on par with the Moto G7.",
                    "Pictures are sharper, so you can see finer details in things like leaves and bricks. In low light, the A50 brightens and punches up colors, while photos taken with the G7 are muddier with much hazier and washed out colors.  The A50 also has a wider dynamic range, meaning scenes with different lighting situations are exposed more evenly compared to the Moto G7.  I did notice that there were times when the A50's HDR effect looked a little too unrealistic, but I preferred it over the Moto G7 nonetheless.  The Galaxy A50 has a second wide-angle camera too, meaning you capture more content within each frame.  This is handy when you want to capture vast landscapes and scenery too.

                    "Choosing A Cell Phone Based On Features: OnePlus 7T Before choosing the phone if you know exactly what features you want, it will help you to make a better decision. If you know what features you want you can get a phone with all the latest features and functionalities if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.  Or if you\u2019re looking for a basic cell phone knowing what features you want ahead of time will help you to avoid spending too much money.  It will prevent you from buying a more expensive phone which has lots of features that you don\u2019t want.  Things To Consider Before Buying A Phone: The design of the phone and the overall look and feel of the phone is very important.  You should be comfortable with the way the phone looks and feels when you hold it in your hand.  For example, if you have small hands and you decided to buy a phone such as the latest Samsung Galaxy Note phone which is a phablet, it would be difficult to use it with one hand.  It would be better for you to get a smaller phone.  Display Screen: OnePlus 7 LCD The LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen on cell phones has gotten better over the years.",
                    "Other tips and tricks you should know There are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when buying a new phone. First of all, don\u2019t be afraid to get a phone from a different manufacturer than you\u2019re used to.  Consider different brands, from well-known ones such as LG, Google, and Samsung, to those you may not be as familiar with including Xiaomi.  Just because you may not know much about a certain company doesn\u2019t mean it makes bad phones.  As already mentioned, you can quickly figure out whether a certain phone sucks or not by reading reviews.  And don\u2019t assume that just because a device is made by the large tech giant that it\u2019s without faults.  For example, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro had issues with the display, various LG phones had bootloop problems, and the Galaxy Note 7 was a fire hazard.  Consider an older, used, or refurbished phone to save money.  Also, don\u2019t just go for the latest phones out there.  Sometimes a year-old or even a two-year-old device might give you everything you need and more for half the price of the latest model.  A lot of the time the latest versions of phones are only minor upgrades over their predecessors but cost a lot more."

I don't recommend one diet over another, but eating more \"real\" foods like fruits and veggies which have all the vitamins and minerals you need naturally will help you with your weight loss goals.  Tips4Running recommends following the Start Walking, Get Running, Lose Weight Plan to gradually work your way back into shape.  It's a great plan with a five week walking schedule, a ten week walk and jog schedule, and a ten week running schedule.  YouTube David T.

Notably, his successor, President Gerald Ford, pardoned Nixon for his involvement in Watergate soon after his resignation.  Lesson Summary President Richard Nixon's well-known paranoia caused him to make irrational decisions which cost him the presidency.  The litmus test for his instability was his handling of the ' Pentagon Papers ' and his involvement in the break-in and subsequent cover-up at the Watergate complex.  Nixon created a secret intelligence team to provide him with constant information on his friends and adversaries.  This intelligence team, which became known as the 'plumbers,' attempted to stop Daniel Ellsberg's leak of confidential information concerning American involvement in the Vietnam War to the media.  While this was a major abuse of executive power, the Watergate Scandal was far worse.  Nixon's powerful victory over George McGovern in the 1972 presidential election was tainted by his actions.  In order to gain an inside edge on his political opponents, Nixon authorized an intelligence team and members of the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) to fund the burglary of the Democratic National headquarters at the Watergate complex.  The intruders, however, failed to set the surveillance equipment up properly."

Woodward and Bernstein were reporters for \"The Washington Post\", and Deep Throat provided key details about the involvement of U.S. President Richard Nixon's administration in what came to be known as the Watergate scandal.  In 2005, 31 years after Nixon's resignation and 11 years after Nixon's death, a family attorney stated that former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  Associate Director Mark Felt was Deep Throat.

Deep Throat was first introduced to the public in the February 1974 book \"All the President's Men\" by \"Washington Post\" reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which was adapted as a film two years later.

Gordon Liddy, Egil Krogh, White House Counsel Charles Colson, former United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, John Dean, and presidential adviser John Ehrlichman.  Howard Simons was the managing editor of the \"Post\" during Watergate.  He dubbed the secret informant \"Deep Throat\", alluding to both the deep background status of his information and the widely publicized 1972 pornographic film \"Deep Throat\".  For more than 30 years, Deep Throat's identity was one of the biggest mysteries of American politics and journalism and the source of much public curiosity and speculation.  Woodward and Bernstein insisted that they would not reveal his identity until he died or consented to reveal it.  J. Anthony Lukas speculated that Deep Throat was W. Mark Felt in his book \"Nightmare: The Underside of the Nixon Years\" (1976), based on three \"New York Times Sunday Magazine\" articles, but he was widely criticized.  According to an article in \"Slate\" on April 28, 2003, Woodward had denied that Deep Throat was part of the \"intelligence community\" in a 1989 \"Playboy\" interview with Lukas."

Never compare your teenager to his peers, friends, siblings and cousins.  Your teen should realize how different people have different strengths.  Comparison creates rivalry.  Make your teenager understand that his only competition is with himself.  And the best way to do even better is to focus on strengths. 8.  Teach Them To Be Stronger : Teach your teenager to build some tolerance level towards teasing or heckling.  Teasing affects every teenager\u2019s self confidence.  A good rule in life is grin and bears it.  Your teenager must learn to tolerate negative emotions to some extent, without losing his cool Your teenager must know that teasing cannot hurt and it should in no way affect his self confidence.  9.  Look For Professional Help: If your teenager suffers from severe lack of confidence and it is starting to affect his academic and/or social life, you may need help from external sources.  Initially, you can try for family counseling with your teen\u2019s favorite relatives.  If the above does not work, it is best to seek professional help, which might uncover the real issue behind this lacking and help your teenager come out of it. 10."

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better. Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better. Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless. Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy. Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate. On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof. Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg to decide which Jollof tastes better. Hilarious!

The debate is so serious that on Jollof Rice Day (August 22), Nigerian and Ghanian Jollof rice are sampled to decide which tastes better.  Interestingly, no one has given a definite answer as to which Jollof rice tastes better.  Ghanaians say the grains in Nigerian Jollof rice are too fat and tasteless.  Nigerians say the grains in Ghanian Jollof rice are too starchy.  Nigerians are a bit forward and loud in their debate.  On social media, they use a lot of videos, memes, gifs and pictures to throw a lot of shade on Ghanaian Jollof.  Sometime in 2016, they even tried to get Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg decide which Jollof tastes better.  Hilarious!  The Ghanians are more on the defensive, trying to block and counteract the attack from Nigerians on social media.  You won\u2019t blame them.  With the ferocity of attack they get from Nigerians on social media, it\u2019s pretty easy to think Nigerian Jollof rice tastes better.",

The Efik speak a language in the Obolo subgroup of the Niger\u2013Congo language group.   They had become a power on the coast of the Bight of Biafra by the early 18th century, by which time the Duke and Eyamba families were their leaders.   They were settled in large, fortified villages along the waterways, in a loose federation with no paramount ruler, living by fishing and farming.  The largest settlements were Ikot Itunko, Obutong and Iboku Atapka.  In the 19th century, the British renamed these as Creek Town, Old Town and Duke Town.   Section::::Religion.   The traditional Efik religion considers that Abasi created the universe.  One tradition says that Abasi's wife Atai persuaded him to let two of their children, a daughter and son, settle on the earth.  They were not allowed to breed, but disobeyed this injunction and became the ancestors of the Efik people.",

The slave trade was banned by a British decree of 1808, and slavery was banned in all British territories in 1833.  Traders from other nations, such as Spain, continued to buy slaves at Calabar until 1842.  In that year, King Eyamba V of Duke Town and King Eyo of Creek Town signed a treaty agreeing to stop trading slaves."

The religion places importance on paying tribute to the village ancestors, particularly those who achieved high rank, since they can affect the fortunes of the living for good or bad.  The earth deity Ala is appeased through the Ogbom ceremony, which makes children plentiful and increases the harvest.   Some Efik belong to the Ekpe secret society.

Don\u2019t leave without scaling the lookouts on Kalban Hill, or wondering at the chiseled rocks of the awesome Tonlong Gorge.  5.  Abuja Source: flickr Abuja Okay, so Abuja ain\u2019t no Lagos.  Purpose-built, enfolded by the soft topography of the inland hills, and formed from clearly delineated districts that house business-suited men and politicians, there\u2019s no grit or grime here (or at least not relatively).  That means the capital is a nice place to relax and unwind following the energy and action of the megalopolis on the coast.  And there are other interesting sights too, like the Abuja Millennium Park and the quad of spear-like minarets that heralds the beautiful Abuja National Mosque.",

Ibadan Source: flickr Ibadan State capital and erstwhile stronghold of the old Oyo Empire, Ibadan hides quite a lot of history and heritage between its streets.  The only problem is, those streets seem to go on forever and ever (some estimations say that Ibadan is the single largest metropolis by geographical coverage in Africa), making the interesting parts pretty hard to find!  A good place to start is in the exhibition rooms of the National Museum of Ibadan, where traditional Egungun garments meet tribal war drums and more.  Then, try to discover the Bower Memorial Tower, before hitting the colonial facades of Mapo Hall. 7.  Kainji Lake National Park Source: flickr Kainji Lake National Park One of the natural jewels of north-western Nigeria is actually not all that natural at all.  Yep, the eponymous Kainji Lake of the Kainji Lake National Park is actually a reservoir, created in 1968 and now surrounded by protected game reserves.  On the western banks of the water is the Borgu area, which hosts sporadic pockets of Guinean woods and plains, the stomping ground of some truly fascinating beasts: hippopotami; roan antelopes and swinging baboons."

The scheme leads victims to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activity (e.g. product sales and/or successful investments), and they remain unaware that other investors are the source of funds.  A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.  Some of the first recorded incidents to meet the modern definition of Ponzi scheme were carried out from 1869 to 1872 by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and by Sarah Howe in the United States in the 1880s through the \"Ladies' Deposit\".",

She was eventually discovered and served three years in prison.  The Ponzi scheme was also previously described in novels; Charles Dickens ' 1844 novel Martin Chuzzlewit and his 1857 novel Little Dorrit both feature such a scheme.  In the 1920s, Charles Ponzi carried out this scheme and became well-known throughout the United States because of the huge amount of money that he took in.  His original scheme was based on the legitimate arbitrage of international reply coupons for postage stamps, but he soon began diverting new investors' money to make payments to earlier investors and to himself.  Unlike earlier, similar schemes, Ponzi's gained considerable press coverage both within the United States and internationally both while it was being perpetrated and after it collapsed \u2013 this notoriety eventually led to the type of scheme being named after him.

Such liquidity crises often trigger panics, as more people start asking for their money, similar to a bank run.  External market forces, such as a sharp decline in the economy, can often hasten the collapse of a Ponzi scheme (for example, the Madoff investment scandal during the market downturn of 2008 ), since they often cause many investors to attempt to withdraw part or all of their funds sooner than they had intended.  Actual losses are extremely difficult to calculate.  The amounts that investors thought they had were never attainable in the first place.

Common fare may be sweet or savoury, ranging from breads and pastries (notably pandesal ), desserts and sweets, street food, to noodle dishes.  In coastal parts of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, and on the Greek island of Corfu, it is referred to marenda, a meal eaten between breakfast and lunch."

Usually taken in the afternoon or for brunch, it fills in the meal gap between the noontime meal and the evening meal, being the equivalent of afternoon tea in the English-speaking world; or between breakfast and lunch.  It is a simple meal that often consists of a piece of fruit, cookies, yogurt, and other snacks paired with juice, milk, hot chocolate, coffee, spirits, or other beverages.  It is typical for Argentines and Uruguayans to have once or merienda around 5pm, between the midday meal and supper.",
                    "It generally consists of an infusion ( tea, mate, coffee, mate cocido, etc.) and a baked snack ( scones, bread, toasts, cake, facturas, etc.), usually accompanied with dulce de leche, honey, butter or jam . In the Philippines, merienda ( Filipino: meryenda or minand\u00e1l) is a generic term encompassing two light meals: the first is a morning snack that may correspond to either brunch, elevenses, or second breakfast; the second one is the equivalent of afternoon tea.  Merienda taken in the early evening around sunset just before or in place of dinner is meanwhile distinctly referred to as merienda cena.  Broadly, merienda is any sort of dish or snack in a portion smaller than the traditional \"full meal\" consisting of rice and a complementary viand (unless the merienda is taken as brunch or merienda cena ), coupled with either a cool or hot drink (usually coffee).  Common fare may be sweet or savoury, ranging from breads and pastries (notably pandesal ), desserts and sweets, street food, to noodle dishes.  In coastal parts of Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, and on the Greek island of Corfu, it is referred to marenda, a meal eaten between breakfast and lunch."

It can be tricky being a vegetarian or vegan on your trip to Argentina, and many often find themselves sampling the meaty delights the country has to offer, as the meat served is some of the most delicious in the world.",

Argentines are used to weathering economic storms, but you might be unpleasantly surprised by the cost of things if you are probably under the impression that this South American country is cheap.  Inflation has been around the 40% mark for the past few years and the latest government devalued the Argentine peso by 30% over two years ago, and the economy has struggled to recover since then.  You have been warned.  It has a tumultuous and fascinating history Dictatorships, colonisation, economic crises, wars, territorial battles, Argentina has seen it all."

So far, attitudes toward open banking in the United States appear to be mixed.  Our consumer survey revealed one in five consumers in the United States find open banking valuable, 1 but the interest is higher among millennials and the Gen Z generation.  This suggests US banks should target younger generations in their initial open banking initiatives.  But consumers also expressed some concerns, especially about privacy, and the security and use of personal data.  This seems to point to a need for banks to educate consumers about the benefits of open banking.

Vlad Andrei \u00b7 Posted on October 29, 2019 May 22, 2021 As Bitcoin and other digital assets continue to grow in adoption and popularity, a common topic for discussion is whether the U.S. government or any government for that matter can exert control of its use.  There are two core issues that lay the foundation of the Bitcoin regulation debate: The digital assets pose a macro-economic risk.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as surrogates for an international currency, which throws global economics a curveball.  For example, countries such as Russia, China, Vene z uela, and Iran have all explored using digital currency to circumvent United States sanctions, which puts the US government at risk of losing its global authority.  Image source International politics and economics are a very delicate issue, and often sanctions are used in place of military boots on the ground, arguably making the world a safer place.

                    "An In-depth Look at Bitcoin Laws & Future Regulation Education An In-depth Look at Bitcoin Laws & Future Regulation By Andrew Norry June 7, 2018 Bitcoin was founded on the principles of decentralization, meaning that the cryptocurrency was not regulated by the central authority in the way that a traditional (or fiat) currency would be.  As Bitcoin, and the blockchain technology behind it, remains quite new and in the early stages of its evolution, authorities are still trying to get to grips with what exactly the technology is before attempting to come up with a plan about how to deal with it, especially in relation to taxation and money laundering issues.  Currently, there is no uniform international approach to Bitcoin and its legality will depend on where in the world that you reside.  However, as authorities gain more experience and knowledge about Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency industry in general, it is likely that at least a certain minimum levels of regulation will come into place in the vast majority of countries.  In addition, the huge gains being made by the cryptocurrency this year has meant that authorities are feeling that urgency about regulating the sector, with over 30 global regulators having announced various approaches to cryptocurrency regulation in recent months.

Founded in 2002, the Winklevoss\u2019s social network was called ConnectU and was very similar to Facebook, many believe that Zuckerberg stole their idea.  ConnectU was originally set up to be a site to connect former Harvard students and eventually other universities.

The Winklevoss\u2019s received $65 million in Facebook shares and cash from the court case, which suggests that it is very likely that some elements of Facebook were indeed stolen.

Of course, as Musk adds, some parts of the rocket would need to be replaced or upgraded over time to accomplish this feat.  The first Falcon 9 Block 5 launch in May 2018 (Credit: SpaceX)  So what does Falcon 9 booster refurbishment actually entail?  The exact process is still shrouded in mystery, but we have some clues.  The Merlin engines burn kerosene which results in soot buildup.  It is therefore necessary to desoot the turbines between launches, which Elon Musk described as \u201c difficult \u201c.  In contrast, the Raptor engine that powers the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster is a much more complex engine than the Merlin, but because it uses methane which burns much more cleanly than kerosene, it is easier to reuse because there is no desooting needed.  According to Musk, when it comes to Raptor\u2019s easy reusability, \u201cnot having long chain hydrocarbons & lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference\u201d.",
                    "SpaceX, Baylor noted, is up to six landings with a single booster. In response, Musk wrote: \"Payload reduction due to reusability of booster & fairing is <40% for F9 & recovery & refurb is <10%, so you\u2019re roughly even with 2 flights, definitely ahead with 3.\"  The comments shed some light on the finances behind reusing rockets, suggesting that the payload that can fly on a single rocket is reduced by less than 40 percent with a reusable configuration and that the cost of recovery and refurbishment makes up less than 10 percent of the initial production cost.  The concept makes sense on paper: If you can reuse a rocket, you're using resources more efficiently.  Musk has compared it to flying single-use airplanes.  Reusing a Falcon 9 could save money.  landbysea/iStock Unreleased/Getty Images But the actual costs have remained relatively obscure.  In 2013, at the All Things Digital conference in California, Musk claimed that the first-stage booster makes up 75 percent of the overall price tag, reported at the time to be around $60 million, SpaceNews reports.  SpaceX's website lists the standard payment plan for a Falcon 9 launch at $62 million."

NASA doesn't use enough rockets to make reusability worthwhile.  Reusable rockets are only valuable if the frequency of launches is great enough to outweigh the cost of developing and utilizing the technology.  It would have been silly to waste Apollo project funds trying to make the Saturn V reusable.  Only about a dozen launches of the Saturn V were planned, so it was cheaper to use a disposable launch vehicle.  When it came time for the Space Shuttle, NASA did plan to do many and frequent launches, so the Orbiter and the Solid Rocket Boosters were designed to be reusable.  It wasn't deemed worthwhile to make the External Tank reusable.  Although the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) were reusable and going to be used on the SLS rocket, NASA doesn't plan to reuse them.  The refurbishing and recertification costs make reuse more expensive than manufacturing new engines.  The French and the Russians did, at one time, work together in an attempt to make the Ariane 5 reusable, but the hardware that would be needed to support the return of the vehicle became too large to make the effort worthwhile.  Making a launch vehicle reusable is very difficult.",

To date, several fully reusable sub-orbital systems and partially reusable orbital systems have been flown.  No fully reusable orbital launch system has yet been demonstrated.   The first reusable launch vehicle to reach orbit was the Space Shuttle, which was not able to accomplish the intended goal of reducing launch costs to below those of expendable launch systems.   During the 21st century, commercial interest in reusable launch systems has grown, with several active launchers.  The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket has a reusable first stage and capsule (for Dragon flights) and expendable second stage, The Spaceship Company has flown reusable suborbital spaceplanes, and the suborbital Blue Origin New Shepard rocket has recoverable first stages and crew capsules.

The single stage to orbit (SSTO) approach has yet to be proven viable, while several partially reusable two stage to orbit vehicles are active or in an advanced stage of development.

Space shuttles are very different.  As opposed to being created to help take a vessel into space like the rocket, space shuttles are the vessel.  Space shuttles were created to take astronauts and cargo into orbit, and the first ever space shuttle flight took place in 1981.  Although most space shuttles have their own way of getting off the ground, a rocket like engine is used in order to launch a space shuttle into the air.  Something called 'rocket boosters' are attached to a space shuttle and burn for a few minutes to help lift the shuttle upwards, and then they fall from the vehicle and drop into the ocean.  Anonymous answered The general difference is that a normal \"rocket\" is something that is used only once and then it is thrown away.  The shuttle on the other hand is designed to be used for around 100 times.  It is reusable.  The idea was that if a space vehicle could be used again and again it would be cheaper then if it were thrown away after each use."

Of course, as Musk adds, some parts of the rocket would need to be replaced or upgraded over time to accomplish this feat.  The first Falcon 9 Block 5 launch in May 2018 (Credit: SpaceX)  So what does Falcon 9 booster refurbishment actually entail?  The exact process is still shrouded in mystery, but we have some clues.  The Merlin engines burn kerosene which results in soot buildup.  It is therefore necessary to desoot the turbines between launches, which Elon Musk described as \u201c difficult \u201c.  In contrast, the Raptor engine that powers the Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy booster is a much more complex engine than the Merlin, but because it uses methane which burns much more cleanly than kerosene, it is easier to reuse because there is no desooting needed.  According to Musk, when it comes to Raptor\u2019s easy reusability, \u201cnot having long chain hydrocarbons & lowering preburner combustion temperature make a big difference\u201d.",

The concept makes sense on paper: If you can reuse a rocket, you're using resources more efficiently.  Musk has compared it to flying single-use airplanes.

Space shuttles were created to take astronauts and cargo into orbit, and the first ever space shuttle flight took place in 1981.  Although most space shuttles have their own way of getting off the ground, a rocket like engine is used in order to launch a space shuttle into the air.  Something called 'rocket boosters' are attached to a space shuttle and burn for a few minutes to help lift the shuttle upwards, and then they fall from the vehicle and drop into the ocean.  Anonymous answered The general difference is that a normal \"rocket\" is something that is used only once and then it is thrown away.  The shuttle on the other hand is designed to be used for around 100 times.  It is reusable.

As of December 2020, the only rocket engines to use electric propellant pump systems are the Rutherford engine, nine of which power the Electron rocket, and the Delphin engine, five of which power the first stage of Astra Space 's Rocket 3.  On 21 January 2018, Electron was the first electric pump-fed rocket to reach orbit.  In comparison to turbo-pumped rocket cycles such as staged combustion and gas generator, an electric cycle engine has potentially worse performance due to the added mass of batteries, but may have lower development and manufacturing costs due its mechanical simplicity, its lack of high temperature turbomachinery, and its easier controllability.  Conversely, an electric cycle engine may have significantly better performance than pressure-fed rocket engines and solid propellant rocket motors .

Rocket engine operation method The pressure-fed engine is a class of rocket engine designs.  A separate gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.  To maintain adequate flow, the tank pressures must exceed the combustion chamber pressure.  Pressure fed engines have simple plumbing and have no need for complex and occasionally unreliable turbopumps.  A typical startup procedure begins with opening a valve, often a one-shot pyrotechnic device, to allow the pressurizing gas to flow through check valves into the propellant tanks.  Then the propellant valves in the engine itself are opened.  If the fuel and oxidizer are hypergolic, they burn on contact; non-hypergolic fuels require an igniter.  Multiple burns can be conducted by merely opening and closing the propellant valves as needed, if the pressurization system also has activating valves.

Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called preburner and the second called main combustion chamber.  In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the increasing volume flow is used to drive the turbopumps that feed the engine with propellant.

NASA doesn't use enough rockets to make reusability worthwhile.  Reusable rockets are only valuable if the frequency of launches is great enough to outweigh the cost of developing and utilizing the technology.  It would have been silly to waste Apollo project funds trying to make the Saturn V reusable.  Only about a dozen launches of the Saturn V were planned, so it was cheaper to use a disposable launch vehicle.  When it came time for the Space Shuttle, NASA did plan to do many and frequent launches, so the Orbiter and the Solid Rocket Boosters were designed to be reusable.  It wasn't deemed worthwhile to make the External Tank reusable.  Although the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) were reusable and going to be used on the SLS rocket, NASA doesn't plan to reuse them.  The refurbishing and recertification costs make reuse more expensive than manufacturing new engines.  The French and the Russians did, at one time, work together in an attempt to make the Ariane 5 reusable, but the hardware that would be needed to support the return of the vehicle became too large to make the effort worthwhile.  Making a launch vehicle reusable is very difficult.",

To date, several fully reusable sub-orbital systems and partially reusable orbital systems have been flown.  No fully reusable orbital launch system has yet been demonstrated.   The first reusable launch vehicle to reach orbit was the Space Shuttle, which was not able to accomplish the intended goal of reducing launch costs to below those of expendable launch systems.   During the 21st century, commercial interest in reusable launch systems has grown, with several active launchers.

Space shuttles are very different.  As opposed to being created to help take a vessel into space like the rocket, space shuttles are the vessel.  Space shuttles were created to take astronauts and cargo into orbit, and the first ever space shuttle flight took place in 1981.  Although most space shuttles have their own way of getting off the ground, a rocket like engine is used in order to launch a space shuttle into the air.  Something called 'rocket boosters' are attached to a space shuttle and burn for a few minutes to help lift the shuttle upwards, and then they fall from the vehicle and drop into the ocean.  Anonymous answered The general difference is that a normal \"rocket\" is something that is used only once and then it is thrown away.  The shuttle on the other hand is designed to be used for around 100 times.  It is reusable.  The idea was that if a space vehicle could be used again and again it would be cheaper then if it were thrown away after each use."

Moreover, during the earth\u2019s re-entry of the Starship, the generated heat will cause a significant technical challenge to keep Hydrogen liquified in the fuel tank.  However, Methane does not have these problems.  Hydrogen embrittlement is a serious issue.  When metal comes into contact with cryogenic Hydrogen, the metal becomes brittle.  Therefore, a reusable rocket design that uses Hydrogen is very complex and challenging.  Hydrogen engines need advanced metallurgy to prevent this embrittlement.  Methane (CH4) does not create this embrittlement issue.  The density of Hydrogen is 70 g/L. In contrast, the density of Methane is 422 g/L.

This was achieved by applying full-flow staged combustion cycle for all the incoming mass of fuel, which is turned into a gas and passes through a couple of turbines before being burned in the combustion chamber.  This allowed the engine to achieve a specific impulse of at the Earth's surface.   The engine testing was underway when the decision was made to cancel the program.

As they get larger, corals grow in a tree-like fashion, forming growth rings.  Grigg counted these rings to estimate age.  In contrast, Roark used radiocarbon dating in his 2006 study to look at the amounts of the isotope carbon-14 in the corals.  14C is produced in the upper atmosphere where it rapidly oxidizes into 14CO2.  All living organisms take up 14C in proportion to the amount of it that is present when they are alive.  Whereas carbon-12 and carbon-13 are stable isotopes, 14C decays to nitrogen with a half-life of 5,730 years.  Monitoring the decay can give researchers an idea of how long ago the isotope formed \u2014 allowing old tissue to be dated.  But some researchers questioned Roark's methods, arguing that carbon in the food the corals were eating from the ocean floor and incorporating into their skeletons could be older than the corals themselves \u2014 giving rise to unduly ancient age estimates.",

There is some evidence that larger amounts of iron may be deposited in the ocean in the future as global warming results in more windblown continental dust.  Theoretically, sea spray and water vapor form low clouds that ultimately cool temperatures at the surface.  Meanwhile, desert dust and carbon dioxide settle into the ocean and act as \"fertilizer\" to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, thereby enhancing the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\u2014a process known as the \"biological pump.\"  Over geological time more than 90 percent of the world's carbon has settled into the deep ocean.

A rack and pannier setup typically includes these parts: Rear rack 2 rear panniers Handlebar bag / case Front rack (optional) 2 front panniers (optional) Bicycle travelers often also strap additional bulky items to the rear rack, like a tent or sleeping pad.

Learn more in our article, How to Choose a Bike for Bikepacking.  Gear Carrying Options for Bikepacking Bikepackers carry the same gear as backpackers plus spare bike tools and tubes.  Fortunately, you have more places to carry it on a bike.  Unlike backpacking, you don\u2019t want to carry a lot of weight on your back.  Instead, most of the weight should be placed low as possible on your bike.  This improves bike handling and your riding comfort.  A typical gear setup for beginners: Daypack: Good for light, bulky items or anything sensitive to vibration.  Dry bag secured to a rear rack: Holds heavier items."

As Cap takes off on his motorcycle, a quinjet arrives to block his way.  Without slowing down, Cap single-handedly takes on the aircraft.  Seeing Cap leap on top of the ship with his shield and take it down in a manner of seconds just proves that there is little that can stand in his way.  Though he prefers to be the hero, he seems to have a real knack for being the outlaw on the run.  4 Defeating Iron Man In an effective twist on the Civil War story, the entire conflict between the heroes comes down to a very personal battle.

Avengers: Endgame was the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film and the grand finale of the MCU's Infinity Saga that spanned Phases 1-3.

As Cap takes off on his motorcycle, a quinjet arrives to block his way.  Without slowing down, Cap single-handedly takes on the aircraft.  Seeing Cap leap on top of the ship with his shield and take it down in a manner of seconds just proves that there is little that can stand in his way.  Though he prefers to be the hero, he seems to have a real knack for being the outlaw on the run.  4 Defeating Iron Man In an effective twist on the Civil War story, the entire conflict between the heroes comes down to a very personal battle.  And as such, there is a lot more at stake.  After learning that the Winter Soldier is responsible for the death of his parents, Tony wants revenge on Bucky.  Obviously, Cap won't allow this.",

By John Orquiola Published Jul 09, 2020 Share Share Tweet Email 0 Comment When Captain America uttered the immortal battle cry \"Avengers Assemble!\"  in Avengers: Endgame, he made every hero who came to fight against Thanos an Avenger.  Avengers: Endgame was the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film and the grand finale of the MCU's Infinity Saga that spanned Phases 1-3.  After their epic defeat in Avengers: Infinity War where Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe with the Infinity Gauntlet, the surviving heroes mounted a desperate series of time heists to acquire the Infinity Stones and reverse the effects of Thanos' snap.  The fate of the universe was decided in Avengers: Endgame 's climactic battle.  If he had been able to reacquire the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos wasn't going to stop at decimating merely half of the universe as his previous self did in Infinity War.",

Now that Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame delivered superhero spectacles unlike any that fans had ever seen, it's easy to forget how revolutionary Captain America: Civil War was back in 2016.  While Civil War was essentially Avengers 2.5, it still never lost sight of Steve Rogers trying to save his oldest friend Bucky and what his devotion cost the entire MCU.  Along with seamlessly introducing Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) into the MCU, Civil War 's centerpiece Berlin airport fight was mind-boggling at the time."

Involve yourself in tech projects at your firm while keeping your current role or do so in your spare time, suggests careers.workopolis.com.  The first step: acquire some tech skills.  You may not be able to go back to school for a full-fledged degree, and the next best thing you can do is to find out about courses that teach the most useful programs.  Ask people who know.  Check out online programs.  Learn HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Python, or whatever you are comfortable with.  Look at startups: Traditional tech companies are not always the best route for you.  Try start-ups, which require people with well-rounded personalities and useful skills such as good communication skills.  Of course, by this time you should have taught yourself some tech skills.

In your application, refer to the technical terms and cultural signals mentioned in the job description (such as \u201cteamwork\u201d), to let the recruiter know you have noticed their specific requirements.  Mention even your odds jobs that taught you the value of collaboration and conflict resolution, for example.  Prepare for your interview, and do some research on your company and interviewers before you arrive.  For software developers, product roles will include a technical interview, usually conducted by a senior engineer or team lead.  They will try to find how you go about handling an abstract problem, and may perhaps not be so much interested in your solution.  You may be questioned about some specialist knowledge.

Search results are not objective truths.  Philippe Huguen / AFP - Getty Images Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST / Updated Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST By Noah Berlatsky, cultural critic In 2010, communications scholar Safiya U. Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces.  She searched \"black girls\" on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people.  Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com.  The first page was filled with similar results.  According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?  Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most.",

The European Commission also imposed a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) fine on the company for favoring its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  Adam and Shivaun Raff, the British couple behind the price comparison website Foundem, played a vital role in bringing the search bias issues to light.

From the example above, one can see that search-engine bias can alter an individual user\u2019s perception of what online information is available, and where that information can be found.  Here is an excellent explanation of search-engine bias from Stanford University: \"  [  T]he phrase \u201csearch-engine bias\u201d has been used to describe at least three distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: Search-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded features in its design that favor some values over others.  Major search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in the lists of results they return in response to user search queries.  Search algorithms do not use objective criteria in generating their lists of results for search queries.  \"While some users may assume search engines are \u201cneutral\u201d or value-free, critics argue that search-engine technology, as well as computer technology in general, are value-laden and thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in their design.\u201d"

There\u2019s absolutely zero user tracking, and you can even add DuckDuckGo\u2019s extension to your browser to keep your activity private.  The search engine has a really useful feature called bangs, which allows you to search directly within another website from DuckDuckGo by typing a prefix.  For example, typing \u201c!ebay magic the gathering\u201d would take you directly to eBay\u2019s search results for the query \u201cmagic the gathering\u201d.  3  . Yahoo!  Yahoo search engine Yahoo has been around for even longer than Google, and while some see it as outdated, it\u2019s still the third most popular search engine worldwide.  It\u2019s even the default search engine for Firefox.  One of the great things about Yahoo is that it\u2019s so much more than just a search engine.  Yahoo\u2019s web portal offers email, news, online shopping, games and more, giving a well-rounded user experience in one place."

The results included a number of anti-Semitic pages and Google claimed little ownership for the way it provided these identities.  Google instead encouraged people to use \u201cJews\u201d or \u201cJewish people\u201d and claimed the actions of White supremacist groups are out of Google\u2019s control.

If you know the web address, or URL, of a site you can find it by typing it into the address bar along the top of your browser.  But what if you don\u2019t know the URL?  You can find pages by following links from other pages but usually it is easier to search for things using a search engine.  These are programs that search an index of the world wide web for keywords and display the results in order.  Finding things online It is useful to think about the words that you use in your search.  Too few and you will get too many results, too many and you may get no results at all.  When you want to find the answer to a question, such as, \u2018What countries did the Vikings raid?\u2019  You need to think about the important keywords.

                    "How Search Engines Work (Overview) Step 1: Crawling Search engines have a number of computer programs called web crawlers (thus the word Crawling), that are responsible for finding information that is publicly available on the Internet. To simplify a complicated process, it\u2019s enough for you to know that the job of these software crawlers (also known as search engine spiders), is to scan the Internet and find the servers (also known as webservers) hosting websites.  They create a list of all the webservers to crawl, the number of websites hosted by each server and then start work.  They visit each website and by using different techniques, they try to find out how many pages they have, whether it is text content, images, videos or any other format (CSS, HTML, javascript, etc).  When visiting a website, besides taking note of the number of pages they also follow any links (either pointing to pages within the site or to external websites), and thus they discover more and more pages.  They do this continuously and they also keep track of changes made to a website so that they know when new pages are added or deleted, when links are updated, etc."

Philippe Huguen / AFP - Getty Images Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST / Updated Feb. 21, 2018, 8:05 AM PST By Noah Berlatsky, cultural critic In 2010, communications scholar Safiya U. Noble was looking for websites to share with her stepdaughter and nieces.  She searched \"black girls\" on Google, expecting to be directed to educational sites, historical information, or pop culture sites for young people.  Instead, the first hit was the site HotBlackPussy.com.  The first page was filled with similar results.  According to Google in 2010, \"black girls\" were defined not by history, interests, or aspirations.  They were defined as porn.  What accounts for such racist, sexist search results?  Most people tend to attribute Google failures or glitches like this to public search patterns; search engines return porn for \"black girls\" because those are the sites that people click on most.",
